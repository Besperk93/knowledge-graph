# Scraping Youtube #

As much of the content hosted on YouTube is loaded in dynamically, we had to use the selenium library in order to automate some behaviours which exposed the information that we required. This included pausing and scrolling pages as well as accessing the required buttons and menus that expose the video transcript.

We were able to extract ober 4,000 video transcripts using this method however further refinements might be able to access a larger range of the total videos and/or access the videos through the parent playlist, allowing us to also extract topic information etc.
