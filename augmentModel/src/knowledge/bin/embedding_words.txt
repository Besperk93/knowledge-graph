some number , a multiple of 10 , three , and six , something we can multiply 10 , three , and six by to get a new denominator that will work for all of the fractions
One
One way [E2]I like to figure this out
I like to figure this out[/E2] out is I look at the biggest denominator , which is 10 , and I think of its multiples
first

The next multiple of 10
10 is 10[/E2] 10 times two , which is 20

in this case

21 out of 30
a larger portion of the group than 10 out of 30
25 out of 30
the greatest portion of the group
from least to greatest
The least , the smallest
10/30 , which again , remember , is equal to 1/3
1/3 is least

you
well , let me just find the Maclaurin series because the Maclaurin series tends to be the simplest to find 'cause we 're centered at zero
zero
second
I
the formula for the Maclaurin series
into roadblocks
You
a simplification , where you could say , well , let me find the Maclaurin series for f of u is equal to six over one plus u , where u is equal to x to the third
this Maclaurin expansion , in terms of u
it a good bit simpler
It
like the sum of a geometric series
's
ourselves
the sum of a geometric series looks like
r
my first term , r is my common ratio
that this is going to be equal to a , our first term , over one minus our common ratio
this denominator
as one minus negative x to the third
okay , well , r could be equal to negative x to the third
just like that
this
as a geometric series , which is very straightforward
I will do this in
I will do [E2]this[/E2] in
in , I 'll do this in this nice pink color

He
a leading scholar of criminal procedure
The Anglo - American system
as the Common Law
live testimony in open court before a jury of your peers
the jury
did you do it , were you blame - worthy , do you deserve the punishment
England
America
Europe
the most notorious example
That
a moniker given to a king - run tribunal decades before the founding , where people were picked up and arrested and then sentenced to criminal punishment and sometimes to death without ever having an opportunity to challenge the charges against them
that kind of a travesty of justice and abuse of power
the foremost thing in the Framers ' minds
for the benefit of the defendant or the accused
about protecting the citizen 's right to control criminal justice
A bunch of the [E2]complaints in the Declaration
complaints in the Declaration[/E2] Declaration are complaints that the King is bypassing these usual modes , that he 's protecting his soldiers by a mock trial from punishment for murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of the states , that he 's depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury , and that he has made the judges subject to his manipulation and pleasure because they do n't have stable salaries
with knowing what you 're being charged with , whether it 's by what 's known as a Grand Jury Indictment or some other method of accusing somebody of committing a crime
with the right to an attorney to represent the accused
what
as speedy
The Supreme Court
well , we 're gon
na balance a bunch of factors
the court
into really focusing on the defendant 's interest in something fast
those cases

One of [E2]the main things there
the main things there[/E2] there is the jury right
a jury selection process
lawyers involved in most of these cases
the victim against the defendant himself or herself
the norm
The defendant
a right to hire a lawyer
Pre - trial proceedings
lots of legal motions
The judges themselves
legal training
professional lawyers who are looking to get this case done with and get on to the next case , or who have seen enough cases that they can bargain back and forth and strike a bargain for this case that 's about where the previous cases came out
an incentive for plea bargaining
the experts who 'd take to run plea bargaining
the lack of investment in your own case that makes plea bargaining possible , or the technical rules
So these cases actually all did go to juries and the expectation was they all would go to juries and the jury right was n't just a right of a defendant
in every case
so many questions about this
today
for one thing
our current system is an improvement on this older system of juries and not so much plea bargaining
the idea
that because the system has grown so large and there are so many cases , that it 's a relief to the prosecution and the court system not to have to have a trial in every case
the benefit to the defendant
that he gets a slightly better deal or is able to plea to a lesser crime
prosecutors
Over the course of the 19th century
most of these cases
from a few percent
to the lion 's share of cases
The prosecutors and defense lawyers
rules of evidence
the judge
too many of them
they

for the point of view of the public
justice done
Criminal defendants in England and other countries around the time of our founding
a right to counsel of any kind
a bit of an innovation on the part of the Framers
a lot of changes to how our legal system works over the years
a system that 's slower and less efficient by design than the criminal justice system of continental Europe
grand juries to authorize every criminal charge
around that
in most cases
petty juries to ensure that every prosecutor 's charge was justified and that the legislature 's criminal laws were n't being applied too broadly
so many threats and tools and sentences that they can make almost everybody give up their jury - trial rights
the Framers
with the volume of cases we 're talking about
The federal crimes they were dealing with
seditious libel , criticizing the government , violations of the revenue laws
Framers
The next thing that would 've surprised [E2]the Framers a great deal
the Framers a great deal[/E2] deal , I think , is the role of the jury today
an act of deep political participation and meaning
the Sixth Amendment
By guaranteeing speedy public trials by jury and due process of law
that citizens , not the government , control criminal justice

I 'm bringing this up not because I think anyone should ever build this machine
in fact
that it contains knives and fire and a small rocket

we 're talking about today , cause and effect
A cause

a couple of little notes and annotations
2010
She
in the finals " of the world 's largest ballet competition " for young dancers , Youth America Grand Prix
an injury
an end
to all of her hopes and dreams
thousands of hours
she
She had worked incredibly hard " and had overcome many challenges to make it to this point
Michaela
the effect
The cause goes here
the cause of that worry
that injury
a lot more than just temporary pain
a possible , end to her " hopes and dreams
Another question
why did she dance despite her injury
a couple of explanations
in the text
her
on stage
that the cause , the reason that Michaela danced even though she was injured is because the opportunity was so great
the opportunity , the chance to earn a scholarship to the ballet school , [E2]that[/E2] 's the cause
us
about cause and effect , we should be thinking about all of the downstream effects
a text
that because you have watched this video , you will therefore better be able to understand a cause and effect relationship in writing
anything
In this video
something pretty interesting about these Lagrange multipliers that we 've been studying
the first portion
one of the examples I showed
that you 're running a company and you have some kind of revenue function that 's dependent on various choices you make in running the company , and I think I said the number of hours of labor you employ and the number of tons of steel you use , you know , if you were manufacturing something metallic
And , you know , this might be modeled as some multivariable function of h and s
about the specifics
This is the real world
you ca n't just spend infinite money
some kind of budget , some sort of amount of money you spend as a function of those same choices you make , the hours of labor you employ , the tons of steel you use
some kind of budget , some sort of amount of money[/E2] money you spend as a function of those same choices you make , the hours of labor you employ , the tons of steel you use
some multivariable function that tells you , you know , how much money you spend for a given amount of hours and given number of tons of steel
you set [E2]this[/E2] equal to some constant
you set this equal to some constant
the amount of money you 're willing to spend
the mental model you have in mind
that you 're looking in the input space , inside the x - y plane , or I guess really , it 's the h - s plane in this case , right
hours
tons
Your inputs
h and s
of this budget
as some kind of curve in that plane
the core value we care about
that , when you maximize this revenue , you know , when you set it equal to a constant I 'm gon na call M star , that 's like the maximum possible revenue , that 's gon na give you a contour that 's just barely tangent to the constraint curve
the review , [E2]this[/E2] gave us the really nice property that you look at the gradient vector for the thing you 're trying to maximize , R , and that 's gon na be proportional to the gradient vector for the constraint function , for this B
like review
at this point
the core idea
that we take this gradient of R , and then make it proportional , with some kind of proportionality constant lambda , to the gradient of B , to the gradient of the constraint function
this point[/E2] point , this value lambda
up till [E2]this point
a proportionality constant
All we care about
that they 're pointing in the same direction
this constant sitting here
to where this little guy actually matters
in the last video
this function called the Lagrangian
it takes in multiple inputs
the same inputs that you have for your budget function and your revenue function , or more generally , the constraint and the thing you 're trying to maximize
the same inputs[/E2] inputs that you have for your budget function and your revenue function , or more generally , the constraint and the thing you 're trying to maximize
those same variables
a higher - dimensional function than both of these two
the way [E2]it[/E2] 's defined looks a little strange at first
the way it 's defined looks a little strange at first
kind of like this random hodgepodge of functions that we 're putting together
through why this makes sense
the thing you 're trying to maximize
of it
as $ 10,000
of that
of h and s and lambda all as these variables
the last video , the reason for defining this function
it gives us a really nice compact way to solve the constraint optimization problem
You set the gradient of L equal to zero , or really the zero vector
a vector with three components
a vector[/E2] vector with three components
you do that , you 'll find some solution
you do [E2]that , you 'll find some solution
right , you 'll find some solution , which [E2]I[/E2] 'll call h star , s star , and lambda
right , you 'll find some solution[/E2] solution , which I 'll call h star , s star , and lambda
right , you 'll find some solution , which I 'll call h star[/E2] star , s star[/E2] star , and lambda
that , you 'll find some solution , right , you 'll find some solution , which [E2]I[/E2] 'll call h star
that , you 'll find some solution[/E2] solution , right , you 'll find some solution[/E2] solution , which I 'll call h star
that , you 'll find some solution , [E2]right , you 'll find some solution , which I 'll call h star
some value that , when you input this into the function , the gradient will equal zero
of course , [E2]you[/E2] might find multiple of these
of course , you might find [E2]multiple of these
multiple of these , right , you might find multiple solutions to this problem
multiple of these[/E2] these , right , you might find multiple solutions to this problem
And ,
each one of them
into the revenue function
the highest value this function can achieve , [E2]that[/E2] is M star , that is the maximum possible revenue , subject to this budget
that when you solve this , you get some specific value of lambda , right , there 's a specific lambda star that will be associated with the solution
this M star
that equals , [E2]I[/E2] 'm saying that 's the maximum possible revenue
whatever the solution to this gradient of the Lagrangian equals zero equation
is
this multivariable function
the revenue
the kind of thing that looks a little bit wacky if you 're just looking at the formulas
20,000
15,000
it means in this context of kind of a revenue and a budget , [E2]I[/E2] think it 's actually pretty sensible , where , really , if we consider this b no longer to be constant but something that you could change , right , you 're wondering , well what if I had a $ 20,000 budget , or what if I had a $ 15,000 budget ?
this function
as the revenue evaluated at h star
As you change b , it changes the solution to this problem
on what the , you know , what the definition of R was and everything there
in principle
in principle , in this context
a maximum possible revenue
like some dummy number that you ignore , and you just look at whatever the associated values here are
2.3
10,000
10,001
the ratio of the change in the maximizing revenue to that db
about 2.3
from $ 10,000
to 10,001
For right now
you to kind of try to sit back and digest what this means in the context of this specific economic example
this is an interesting and even useful tidbit of knowledge to have about Lagrange multipliers
with that
in the next video
a relatively stable , relatively peaceful time for Rome
The empire
into three different states
Rhine
Danube
Germanic
attacks across the Rhine and the Danube from Germanic tribes
All of that
this a very unstable period for Rome
Christians
Roman
as the last emperor that really persecuted the Christians because they did n't follow the Roman religion , they did not worship the emperor as a god
too many borders
East
West
separate empires
he
in multiple videos
after Diocletian
another significant emperor
Constantine

Christian
the first Christian emperor
Byzantium

Now it was still one unified empire
veto power over the emperor to the West
at Adrianople
Ravenna
With the idea
the East and West
After that
them in blue
455
Rome
to Carthage
a hit
the big question that historians have a lot of fun thinking about
why did all of this happen ?
Why did the Roman Empire fall
to some degree
that it lasted so long
in terms of the causes of its decline
about several of them
in terms of the causes of its decline , [E2]we[/E2] 've talked about several of them in this video
each other
Some historians
that the Roman Empire stopped expanding , and it needed that expansion in order to keep getting more land and more slaves that really drove its economy
Another theory
that as the Germanic tribes settled , they actually became more and more part of the Roman military , and some of them were officially part of the military , some of them were mercenaries , soldiers for fortune , paid soldiers , and so you can imagine their allegiance to Rome was not as strong
Some folks
Christianity may have been a factor
A lot of people
it 's corruption , instability
Huns
Sassanids
invasions , not just from the Germanic tribes and the Huns , but also the Sassanids on the East
the way that [E2]I approach this
I approach this[/E2] this is I try to solve for the derivative , and if when I solve for the derivative , if I get dy , dx is equal to some function of y times some other function of x then I say okay , this[/E2] this is separable
as ,
from this first equation
to the second equation
just by dividing both sides by g of y and multiplying both sides by dx
you have a separable equation you can integrate both sides
y
from both sides
3
1
3 minus y
times 1
over x
I 'm able to write the derivative as a product of a function of y , and a function of x
I could show you , [E2]I[/E2] could multiply both sides by dx
I could show [E2]you[/E2] , I could multiply both sides by dx
na just do the same technique
in a slightly different colour
2x
2y
to both sides
2
2 times the derivative of y with respect to x is equal to negative 2x minus 2y plus 1
now see [E2]I[/E2] can divide everything by two
now see I can divide everything by two
the derivative of y with respect to
how I can write this as a product of a function of x and a function of y
as a function of x times a function of y
one over y squared plus y dy is equal to x squared plus x dx
the derivative
And here my algebraic tool kit of how do I separate x and y so I can write this as a function of x times a function of y ,
to me

the tips we 'll be sharing today
to this moment
a team collecting them for the Q&A portion
Dan
the Chief Learning Officer
all of that that you 'll see here
on what we understand about motivation from research about how to keep kids motivated
one of the first things to understand
that we can really boil down a lot of the research on motivation to a pretty simple formula
you think you
about how to motivate our kids , we can think about how can I help them feel like they 're likely to be successful and how can I help them see some of the value in this activity
something as simple as , " Hey , this afternoon , we 're going to read this book together , " or " We 're going to write three sentences
four sentences
about in the morning setting goals for the day
week
daily
about maybe setting a longer , maybe a week goal that then you break down into daily goals
How many sentences do [E2]you[/E2] think you can write today
the double plus there of thinking about both success and value of the activity
why I encourage a lot of goal setting and thinking about how to do that
everything from high fives to thinking about , you know , small , different things that kids like to do
they might find successful
everything
from , you know , a little online confetti to all kinds of things that just , you know , recognize that there
a good time to reflect
that helped you be successful in meeting that goal
that often you need a little bit of help to get over that
everything from asking you for help
new things , [E2]it[/E2] makes new connections to new neurons
that in itself
you remember the things that you 've learned
you a stronger , better learner
in a better message
research
kids who understand and get some of that understanding of how their brain works actually do persist more than students who just say , " Hey , keep trying , hey , keep going
you better and a better learner
the fourth tip , thinking about effort leading to success
those
the world , [E2]those[/E2] are the kids that keep learning and keep trying to find new things
to what I was just saying about linking things to the world
your kid 's interests
kids
why should I learn this
is this going to help me do
is this[/E2] this going to help me do
how does this relate to things I 'm interested in
how does this[/E2] this relate to things I 'm interested in
the activity
lots of concerns
Even those of us who , you know , are successful and are good students
tricks to keep ourselves motivated
when I 'm writing , I will say , " If I write one page here , I 'll reward myself with a piece of chocolate
the danger of rewards
that if a kid is already interested in doing something , like it 's already bringing them happiness and joy , and you start rewarding it with external things like candy and those kinds of things , they start to lose , actually , some of their internal motivation and start thinking , " Oh , I 'm just doing this for the reward
math
what 's for dinner
all of those things
They can be picking which TV show you watch ,
good rewards
our seven tips , thinking about setting goals and monitoring progress , celebrating success , help your kids manage those roadblocks , emphasize that effort leads to success , encourage curiosity , establish relevance , and use rewards wisely

Kristen
Rebecca
the first question we have
from Rebecca
you mentioned this in terms of tip , I believe it 's tip number six
kids feel like what they 're learning in school and what they do is really relevant to their lives
the most common place we hear this
in math
Cooking
a lot of math , specifically , a lot of fractions
There can be , [E2]you[/E2] know , if you 're doing a double batch
There can be , you know , if you 're doing a double batch
about doubling a fraction
cooking
a good example for a lot of math issues
about what kinds of careers are the skills they 're learning good for
these are the kinds of things
we do n't know what you want to be when you grow up
what you want to be when you grow up
a good idea
that we 're learning now , [E2]it[/E2] turns out that this is something that accountants use a lot
that we 're learning now , it turns out that this [E2]is something that accountants use a lot
is something that accountants use a lot , " or " This is something that someone who 's doing a lot of , who 's an oceanographer learns a lot about these topics that you 're learning about in science today , thinking about those , the kinds of careers , that link to the different things that they 're learning is another way to bring some of this to life
is something that accountants use a lot[/E2] lot , " or " This is something that someone who 's doing a lot[/E2] lot of , who 's an oceanographer learns a lot[/E2] lot about these topics that you 're learning about in science today , thinking about those , the kinds of careers , that link to the different things that they 're learning is another way to bring some of this to life
the bicycle example
that 's all about simple machines and pulleys and chains and all of that
things that kids are learning that relate to them
But it takes some work
like one thing ,
one of the things we know about distance learning
And it 's in ,
that kids who are best at it are kids who are what we call self - regulated learners
kids that are actually capable of setting goals , capable of monitoring their own progress , kids that can create , organize schedules for themselves
Those
skills that you can help your child with
their schedule for the day
the other piece that often happens in middle school
you start switching teachers
Where in elementary school , [E2]you[/E2] just had one
Where in elementary school , you just had one
multiple teachers
the , next week they create what the schedule looks like
that a lot of kids are really motivated by that
the pieces about making new friends
you miss your friends
that 's a great point
when you transition to
when
a lot of like agency and being responsible and getting to class on time
tons of new kids from different schools that you 're going to at the same time
there 's a lot of challenges for those kids
a good way for you to help support them and tailor it to what their needs are
a question from Dora
we get , we hear this question a lot , is how do you manage roadblocks
all of those
I do n't know how to do this
things where kids can really benefit from things like the growth mindset piece that I was talking about
Yesterday
the two - digit by minus two - digit problems
three of them
the key that then will kick things off
a lot of questions
Sue
a couple of questions around goals
the idea of setting goals
what your , the goals that your schools are setting
the third
from Ed , who 's asking for very specific examples for their grade school kid
challenges with getting their child to help set their own goals
the kids
that much
the teacher
that the kids are struggling to do this
a lot of teachers
tons of experience doing all of this in the regular classroom
me
of what those were
the third one was , how do you get your kids to kind of play into goal setting if your kid 's reluctant to kind of engage with the goal setting exercise , right
the level of goals piece
another one to , it 's really good to talk to your student 's teacher , talk to your kid 's teacher about , you know , what kinds of levels that they 're at , because it is going to be individual for kids
But then it should be as something that [E2]you[/E2] 're looking for
But then it should be as something that [E2]you 're looking for
you 're looking for , [E2]you[/E2] want kids to
you 're looking for[/E2] for , you want kids to
that kids are , they 're having to put in some cognitive efforts , like think hard about this and reason through it
to them
too low a goal
too high a goal
a little bit of help
signs that they 're right about at the right place
you 're looking for in terms of where the step , what that is
a good guide
at the things that your teachers , that your child 's teacher 's assigning and thinking about , you know , how that can , how you can help break that down
The other piece to that first question
it seems to be too much , that 's being assigned
a little bit of progress
even after an hour
about , again , that idea of rewards
about what 's the reward for that
about rewards for helping set goals
what type of feedback is most helpful for kids and does it depend on the stage of where they 're learning
some place where there
what we call elaborated feedback
that to be specific to the task that they 're doing
That answer
because of XYZ
with feedback about effort
things like saying , "
time for one more question
a lot more questions than we have time for
we want to prioritize our kids ' emotional wellbeing in all of this
that it 's just too much that they 're thinking about
that 's great advice for adults as much as kids
that 's some good advice for us all to follow
so many more questions
more
in a future webinar
you 're incredibly busy during this time
you investing your time to this session
quite a few resources
at khanacademy.org
in previous videos
that a ball of mass m rotating in a circle of radius r at a speed v has what we call angular momentum
the question
will this rod also have an angular momentum that 's equal to mvR and it wo n't
yourself
all this mass
In other words
at a radius of R
some of the mass ,
for this rod
at a radius R
the part that travels at the full radius R
The rest of these pieces of mass , like this one in here
a circle
a diminished R value
the angular momentum of an object whose mass is distributed in a way that some of the mass is close to the axis
we 're gon na do in this video
the goal
well , I 've got the formula for the angular momentum of a single particle traveling at a single radius
the angular momentum of some piece of [E2]the object
the angular momentum of some piece of [E2]the object[/E2] object , let 's say that little piece of mass , is gon na be , well the mass of that little piece , I 'm gon na write m
It 's not the entire mass of this entire rod
It 's not [E2]the entire mass of this entire rod
the entire mass of this entire rod , [E2]it[/E2] 'd just be the mass of that small piece times the speed of that piece times the radius that it is at
the entire mass of this entire rod[/E2] rod , it 'd just be the mass of that small piece times the speed of that piece times the radius that it is at
This is gon na be really hard
different speeds
at different radii
there 's an infinite amount of these
the mvR 's of every piece of mass on this rod
in other words
m1 , v1 , R1 m2 , v2 , R2 and so on
with this
a clever way to deal with this
One problem we have
that each mass has a different v
them
your radius
from the axis here
every point on this rotating rod
a different speed v
what we do
as summation of m
in
what v was
The omega
the same
for every single mass in here
Every single mass
at the same angular speed
as the summation of mR squared
that summation and then that whole thing
an infinite sum
the sum of all the mR squareds
its total moment of inertia
just the moment of inertia of an object ,
just [E2]the moment of inertia of an object[/E2] object ,
the moment of inertia of an object
a great formula
All right , angular momentum , shoot
how you do it
its angular speed , you get its angular momentum
the distance from the axis to the outside edge
the angular speed of this object was , let 's say 10 radians per second , [E2]we[/E2] can figure out the angular momentum of this rod
the angular speed of this object was , let 's say 10 radians per second , we can figure out the angular momentum of this rod
by saying that the angular momentum is gon na equal the moment of inertia
the moment of inertia of a rod about the end
the mass rotates at the same radius and you wanna find the angular momentum , the easiest way to get it
with the formula mvR
the object
with the formula I omega , where I is the moment of inertia of the object
Nate tried to find the derivative of X
Which
he needed to do
a problem
This is going to
the product rule
my correcting red pen
the derivative of this
two X plus five
two X plus five times the second thing
in another color
the derivative of sine of X
cosine of X
what we should have been seeing at this step right over here
the product of the derivatives
that the derivative of the products is the same thing as the product of the derivatives
Katy
Katy tried to find the derivative of two X squared minus four
the chain rule
Just as a review
look , if we 're trying tot ake the derivative with respect to X
as F prime of G of X
our F function
as a thing that takes its input and takes it to the third power
this thing
the F prime of G of X
the derivative of two X squared
times four X
she needed to do
in order for it to be correct
Njoman
Njoman tried to find the derivative of sine of seven X
a derivative of sine of this expression
In fact
the chain rule [E2]you[/E2] wanna find the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside
the chain rule you wanna find the derivative of the outside function with respect to the inside
the derivative of seven X[/E2] X squared
14 X
The derivative of [E2]four[/E2] X
that step looks good
something strange
the cosine of seven X
14
that whole thing
14 X plus four
AP
one of the key errors that the folks at the college board , AP folks told us about
dealing with these transcendental functions cosine , sine , tangent , natural log that are written like this and people see the parentheses and see another parentheses , their brain just says oh let me multiply these two expressions in parentheses , but that 's not right , because if we were to add parentheses this is what this is implying
the 14 X plus four
these strangely fun
in the numerator
the quotient rule , [E2]you[/E2] would , in the numerator you would take the derivative of the first expression times the second expression and then minus the first expression times the derivative of the second expression all of that over , or I should say the derivative of the numerator expression times the denominator expression , minus the numerator expression times the derivative of the denominator expression , all of that over the denominator expression squared
the quotient rule , you would , [E2]in the numerator[/E2] numerator you would take the derivative of the first expression times the second expression and then minus the first expression times the derivative of the second expression all of that over , or I should say the derivative of the numerator[/E2] numerator expression times the denominator expression , minus the numerator[/E2] numerator expression times the derivative of the denominator expression , all of that over the denominator expression squared
a correct application of the the quotient rule
the derivative of X to the [E2]one half
one half
Derivative of X to the fourth
four X to the third
to that
exponent properties
oh there , everything is terms of X to 3.5
the right answer
any mistakes
a bone to pick
all of this hairy calculus and algebra
hey , you know what , this is the same thing
the derivative with respect to X of X to the one half
what the square root of X is
what one over X to the fourth is
the same thing as that
the same thing as the derivative
with respect to X
the ( mumbles ) products
3.5
X to the negative 3 . , X to the negative 3.5
from that

the cosine of DEC
well is n't this side adjacent ?
the adjacent side
, I could call it EC
the length of segment EC
the hypotenuse-- the hypotenuse
side DE , or ED , however you want to call it
so the length of it is
so the length of [E2]it[/E2] is

it said like no hard questions in the grant agreement
sure , I 'm gon na ask you a few hard ones
PISA
at that data
US
Latino
just as a matter or a mathematics , how are we gon na improve a US public education
that the strategies we 're pursuing and I can tell you some of them will help all kids , but we 're really focused on those target populations
Things we 're doing
right up your alley
Sal
in curriculum and comprehensive instructional systems
The goal
that you give students opportunities , both inside the classroom
a lot of energy
in building full course curriculum over the last five years , and then trying to scale those with districts and intermediaries across the country
A second thing we 're really focused on
teacher prep
great teachers
In 24 cities across the country
intermediaries to really focus on one of three big problems , getting kids on track
groups
in their communities
your sense of either cynicism or optimism
A concrete example
the common core standards
Urban areas
as being cesspools of ineffective practice
by completion of the advanced Regents exam
a tidal wave or a giant transformation
every single day we 're making small steps that ensure , that more kids will be able to complete standards and go on to a productive life
education
And it 's just hard work
for a lot of social challenges
We have to invest in that
the underlying narrative behind it
eighties
nineties
on an earlier standards movement from the eighties and nineties
that the standards are remarkably enduring
40
43
They 've modified
they 've tinkered them
them , they 've made them more appropriate to their local context
them , they 've made them[/E2] them more appropriate to their local context
a little bit of a lightning rod
this question
as really a governors to your point like States by state
it 's no pre - Common core
that in any standards creation everyone kind of wants to throw in their favorite pet project
Singapore
Finland
that it 's the best practice and it makes common sense to focus on fewer things but do them with real depth
that if you the correlation between being able to do well in the common core standards and any other strong standards , especially many of them very much derived from the common core is very high
like a little bit of a a red herring for all of that
their practice problems
that we were always individualizing the work
idiosyncratic units , that could n't be shared across groups of teachers to really improve their practice over time
Teaching
as an individual
weekly
that 's the big next advance
real time improvement
real - time measurement
a standardized test
our foot
on the gas
in the process of going deeper
the object of study and professional development
something abstract that a supervisor develops
what students are learning in your classroom
's what 's job embedded professional development is about
students and families in this equation
it 's the mixture of what we do in class and out of class that can really be powerful , to driving kids to higher levels of mastery
everybody should be on that platform
, you mentioned that you have a renewed or a double - down focus on historically under - resourced populations
about algebra one
in your mind
as something of a of a really important leverage point
a foundational language and gateway course for higher STEM classes
it 's one of the most failed courses in high school
Students who do n't succeed in it
for the remaining three years that they 're there
In some ways
that pivot point where you 're really not learning you 're out in your mathematics tables , but you 're using a hundred apply mathematics to solving problems
that first foray into abstract reasoning
not only in math but in a variety of other subjects
the funny part to me
I knew all that intellectually , but we 've started to gravitate towards some of the math work largely because that 's where the field wanted to go
a subject that young people were struggling with in ninth grade
a significant number of our grant tees hunkering down on mathematics
the ability to really build great products with grantees around mathematics and get them out like illustrative map and a variety of the open educational resource materials available
So we gravitated towards math largely because the field was gravitating towards math ,
So many jobs
to STEM
In college
to statistics
there 's lots going on in math
an incredibly exciting field
as a kid
a new word
essentially the community college is saying , you 're not even ready yet to learn college algebra
College algebra
like algebra[/E2] algebra one and a half
that college algebra is one of these courses that you have to take
Some people
does it have to be a requirement
restaurants
into the training programs
They become managers
district managers
they 're [E2]they[/E2] 're kind of stuck doing the non non - managerial the non career track jobs
the world
For better
for worse
algebra
so many kids , algebra is in theory , learned as early as eighth or ninth grade
seventh
other classes called geometry and algebra two , and pre
is going on
it ranges from the dearth of really high quality teachers
a lousy job preparing math teachers
a better job
there are real challenges in making math relevant
pedagogies that do n't necessarily show why we 're learning a particular math problem , why it evolved in the history of mathematics and what problem it 's solving
making it much more relevant just in its own history is important
What problems
in the world
the new technologies
opportunities to try to think about math in different ways
by visualizing it
Other people
through multiple ways of solving a problem
if we can really institutionalize and scale those tools , we 're goinna see a rapid growth in math over the next five to 10 years
your sense of just students foundational knowledge
the students
at the college level
you could imagine an incredibly demoralizing I 've visited middle school classes that should n't be learning algebra
eight
eight times seven
to Oh , it 's 56
we can address that
on top of that
a great question
one of the challenges is to understand what greater precision
one of the things I did n't mention , but I think about a lot because of my own personal experience in mathematics
what turns the person on to believe that their math person or what alienates a person from being a math person early on in their lives
in math in particular
that so many young kids , particularly girls , particularly poor kids do n't think of themselves as math people
through the intervention of a really good teacher who brought me back at the end of the year
me feel bad
for a number of years
from math
for math
it 's foundational skills
it 's the way we emphasize those foundational skills to build Napa identity , and enthusiasm for math
an incredibly elegant and beautiful way of representing the universe
a math teacher who said a beautiful problem is like a beautiful poem
there 's a real grain of truth in that
gains in student achievement
poetry
what s amazing , the math that you 're doing is just abstract symbols but it 's representing a very pure idea that I think sometimes can give you chills
20 % of which
for learning loss
a lot of money that is flowing into the States into school systems
your hopes and fears there
everything that 's occurring in philanthropy
people
money
on the best idea that they 've thought
that much of the learning loss need for acceleration has been created by the digital divide
eight to 12 million students who do n't have regular access either to equipment or access to the internet
the strategies that are research - based that can be helpful
opportunities to go on Khan Academy and do the extra homework
End of your courses is really important
just individual needs like tutoring
about identifying those best practices in coordinating I 'm sure like you , I really have the opportunity to talk to a lot of superintendents and chiefs around the country
one of the joys of my job
in the next two or three months we 're gon na see some really interesting plans coming from a variety of different districts addressing learning loss , addressing social emotional needs , thinking hard about the digital divide , thinking hard about , the host of things that need to happen to enable our young people to recover quickly
reasonable political pressure on both fronts

a question from Charles Lamar Dreyden on Facebook asking , is there , well , I 'll I 'll paraphrase the question , your use on standardized testing
measurement tools showing correlation between success in standardized testing
we need to be innovating a lot more in this space to be honest with you
one thing that 's fascinating
grades are very predictive
a matter of statistics
multiple opportunities to view some young person
SEL and executive function skills embedded in it
we need assessments I think testing is good
part of learning is having a little anxiety with what you 're learning to retain it and then ultimately synthesizing it with other things over the course of the year
the , I guess the , the reality for me is there four things we ask tests to do and it may be too many
tests
tests that enable us to compare schools and make sure we 're living up to our equity responsibilities
need to do a lot more in assessment
that the foundation we 're committed to innovating around it
as continuous
part of part of the learning
it more actionable
a good thing
we 're over time maybe just final thoughts on anyone listening
You know
we have parents listening
teachers
what would be the big takeaway that you would want them to have for their own lives
what you 're saying , we 're coming off of incredibly complicated time with the COVID pandemic
teachers are going to be leaning , in
resources to be really creative
we need to be a little brave and think about how can we transform the system
where we were where we had difficulties and challenges
students
At this point
what was sometimes ran , tracked or quickly put together
it 's a time of incredible promise if we lean into it , real challenges as there always are but real opportunities , if we 're brave enough to seize them - Right

a Editor in Chief
his thinking
that if we are going to serve the mission of LinkedIn , which is not just to connect people but to help make them better at what they do or what they want to do , we do that by helping them stay informed and helping make sure that they are building their own voice
the way that
through getting them the right news at the right time , and then getting them to talk about it
an editor
the best of what we see

you come to LinkedIn , [E2]you[/E2] are coming with your professional identity
you come to LinkedIn , [E2]you are coming with your professional identity
you come to LinkedIn , [E2]you[/E2] are coming with your professional identity , you are saying who you work for , who you have worked for in the past
you come to LinkedIn , [E2]you are coming with your professional identity[/E2] identity , you are saying who you work for , who you have worked for in the past
with your colleagues who can vouch for you or talk about what you 're good at also
a feeling that , just like you 're seeing real people , that you are seeing real news and information on there
that it is important to have an editorial voice and an editorial perspective on LinkedIn
2020
for instance
with the latest election
something at the top
that says , " The 2020 election
trusted information from trusted sources
all the way through the election process
that if you are , no matter what you do , if you come to LinkedIn , that you have that one place to go to get that information and say , here is what 's going on in the world

about what 's going on around them and what they 're seeing
as editors
to people who might be in the news
Spotify
Megaphone
to people who are in that industry
them to share that on LinkedIn
the last point is that you asked about like how this is different
The big difference
that we 're a professional social media site
the
, I think- Oh for a lot of us , sharing on social is always worrisome
a safe thing to talk about
unlike some other social media where you might fire it up and talk about whatever you feel like talking about , there 's an extra level of concern and seriousness that takes place on LinkedIn because of the professional profile
What do [E2]you[/E2] think is the future of some of the other social media platforms
a simple solution for , you know , how do you balance people being able to put ideas out there while some ideas are from Russian bots , or just people who are trying to put out misinformation
that my own beliefs about what 's important for us to figure out in the social media landscape is how do we make sure that there are real identities behind everything
One of the key drivers to LinkedIn 's success
That I think that there is-
this idea that you have to stand for what you are saying
you think twice about what it is that you 're saying
that 's really important
that what the other social media sites are doing in terms of labeling content is really important
the role of fact checkers is important
that social media sites keep investing in those areas
the last thing I would say is that I think that- I watch how my kids use social
into it
with a certain understanding of what it 's for and what it 's not for , and when to take it seriously
with a certain understanding of what it[/E2] it 's for and what it[/E2] it 's not for , and when to take it[/E2] it seriously
if this generation that has grown up with social as being the primary way that they are , not just getting information but building their voice , has a better handle on what they 're seeing there
themselves
there will be
you 're right
guests
we 're obviously in the midst of a COVID crisis
your view ,
what are you seeing in LinkedIn
there are a lot of different ways to look at it
it 's gon na be years before business travel comes back
$ 2 billion deals
over VC ,
over VC , over these kind of calls
on that lunch traffic
just leisure dinners
anything that involves us getting together in person
a while
that there is a need to find a path that takes you from this area into something else
virtual big tech
this kind of skills - based workforce ,
this kind of skills - based workforce , this idea that what you do is really a collection of skills versus you being an expert in one particular job
as an example of that
you could be a great travel-
you could be [E2]a great travel-
a great travel- [E2]You[/E2] might be a great , I do n't know , person in travel
a great travel- You might be a great , I do n't know , person in travel
a great travel-[/E2] travel- You might be a great , I do n't know , person in travel
a good travel
my favorite example of this is , I was talking to someone at a insurance company who said that when they look for insurance adjusters , people that can work with people around their accidents , and try to understand what happened and who 's at fault and whatever else goes into being an insurance adjuster , this executive said , we hire bartenders
bartenders
this ability to get people to tell their stories
if you 're a bartender , you do n't think of yourself as being a story aggregator
a skill
that is accelerated by COVID
, is people realizing that they 've built their careers on potentially shaky ground , and that if they are going to continue to work it is gon na come from being able to hop from industry to industry and job
your skills
that will enable you to do that
about the in - person workplace
no it might be bigger than ever because people[/E2] people need more space
on that debate
the workplace might change in how we , what we do in work , it will become a lot more flexible
that this need for human interaction and the kind of ideas that come through serendipity , through bumping into someone in a hallway , through the meeting
there is a real benefit for that
a chance to go on a walking meeting with someone who I have n't met before
March
And we were planning on getting together
the first time I 've done it since March
for 45 minutes
about questions that she 'd had about how to do something in her job
a free flowing conversation in a way that I have not experienced in a long time
that that is something that , once we start getting that again , it 's gon na be hard to give it up
a believer in the full
it 's sustainable
even in my job
to your point
that I 'm able to have more efficient and effective fundraising meetings with potential donors right now than before with all of that overhead
a movement
with you
that , going back to your last question though , I do think that it is easier to have that kind of pledge right now when we are all acting , when we 're all in this world
in - person
there 's some kind of network effect that kind of happens when you just do n't want to feel left out
FOMO
a series of these small rooms , virtually connected
to going back to that
that that 's a nice to have , from just like your own personal contentment point of view
having the time with your family , having a better family life , connecting with your kids , with your partner , that 's gon na make you better , more effective at work
It 's bad for the environment
people still have to think about it
that a younger generation especially thinks of it as a given that their voice needs to be heard , that creating is part of who they are
that 's a great thing
This idea of democratizing voice
something that I think is one of the best things to happen

Communication skills
the number one thing that hiring managers are looking for
this , where we are all behind our computers , or writing on Google docs or however else we 're communicating[/E2] communicating , this ability to be able to communicate clearly and consistently

at the jobs of the future , [E2]we[/E2] were just looking at , sorry , I 'm just pulling this up right now , we did a look at what are some of the jobs where we know that there is outsized demand , and we expect that kind of outsized demand to continue
that people are- [E2]We[/E2] know that technology is underpinning every single company today

about what they were looking for

about the idea of genre in fiction
Genres
types of stories that share similar themes , styles , or subject matter
mysteries
science fiction is a genre
science fiction is [E2]a genre
fairy tales are a genre
a genre
Each one of these types of stories
certain elements that you gradually come to expect from them
Fantasy stories
magic spells and imaginary creatures
Romance stories
lots of smooching
Mystery stories
a crime and a person who tries to solve it
You can call these tropes
You can call [E2]these tropes

equations like this
by equivalence
nine
one thing that [E2]I could do to essentially write the same equivalence statement
I could do to essentially write the same equivalence statement[/E2] statement is I could distribute this three onto the X or onto the X plus one and then this part of it could be rewritten as three X plus three and then we have minus X is equal to nine
as two X
the case
that X plus three is equal to nine , then [E2]it[/E2] is also the case that three times that X plus one minus X is equal to nine and vice versa
that X plus three is equal to nine , then it is also [E2]the case[/E2] case that three times that X plus one minus X is equal to nine and vice versa
other equivalence preserving operations
In general
equivalence preserving
Any X that 's satisfies any of these other equations
this last one
both sides
by two
any X that satisfies this and there 's one , X equals three
the other ones
well , what are some non equivalence preserving operations
X plus one is equal to two
X
X is equal to six
by only multiplying the right hand side by value it 's not the case [E2]that[/E2] anything that satisfies X equals six will satisfy X equals two
one temptation
well , I wanna do the same thing to both sides , I could just divide both sides by X , what 'll happen in that scenario
five equal six or six equal five
there 's nothing that could satisfy five equal six
an equivalence preserving operation
the way that I would tackle it
the way that [E2]I would tackle it
in order to be clear that you 're preserving equivalence here
I would tackle it[/E2] it is I would subtract five X from both sides and if you do that , and that is an equivalence preserving operation , you could subtract that expression from both sides or that term from both sides and then you would be left with zero is equal to X and now zero equals X and five X equals six X , these are equivalence statements
I would tackle it is I would subtract five X from both sides and if you do that , and that is an equivalence preserving operation , you could subtract that expression from both sides or that term from both sides and then you would be left with zero is equal to X and now zero equals X and five X equals six X , these are equivalence statements
anything that makes this one true
They are equivalent equations
a sense of why dividing by zero is not a good idea
zero , I would get zero
these two
equivalent statements
zeros
They have a different set of Xs [E2]that[/E2] will satisfy them and so you have to be very careful when you 're dealing with things that are either are zero you can add or subtract zeros
for most of human history
a lot of time where we would just look at things and not be overstimulated , there 'd just be a bubbling brook
by social media , by things we have to do at school , things that we have to do at work , our cell phones ringing , getting different text messages and
as much peace and as much stillness as we would like
everyday
we are up now
different types of technology
we 've definitely improved from earlier this week when I was operating from my not - so - great wifi
for joining , for those of y' all that this is the first day you 're joining this homeroom
a way for all of us to connect
approaching a billion kids around the world who are in that situation
And I guess you could say the main Khan Academy
for sure
all the way in math through elementary ,
A lot of people associate us with videos
just videos
most of what we put resources to
interactive exercises that have solutions to[/E2] to every problem
interactive exercises that have solutions to every problem
a Beta , which is kind of a first draft version of our English and language arts

some corporations who have stepped up in record time over the weekend
to your questions
the first question , and this is one we get pretty consistently
as a parent , how should I figure out what my child should be learning
in each of those areas
for say math
some grade levels that might be appropriate for students of a certain age
on those units
if the student feels like [E2]they[/E2] know
if the student feels like they know
on those units , if the student feels like [E2]they[/E2] know
the game mechanics for the entire site
unit test , course challenges
one method
them simultaneously working at grade level
this situation , might be , especially if you have a child , or you are a student who 's historically struggled in math , I recommend spending more time so you can work at grade level , and make sure that you do n't have any Swiss cheese gaps going forward
in English and language arts
If you really wanna go for gap finding , you should start students at the very basic material
the only way to go skill by skill and ensure that students have no gaps
many high school students who are not fluent at middle school skills
that week to start from the beginning and build up all your skills , then when you get to the middle school math , or the algebra , you 'll find that you 're in the right place
large brains
letters
over the years
from Khan Academy
from Khan Academy , from people who are past their career
Newton
Leibniz
decades
that 's incredibly exciting
your perspective on everything
at dinner parties
The teachers will spend some time with the students that are learning at their own time and pace on Khan Academy
it 's a bad idea to start all of your students at kindergarten and let them progress as quickly as possible
Tim

halfway
his grading
based on that
their grade
the way it flows in the classroom ,
he 's able to look at the data of what students are working on ,[/E2] , who 's engaged
some of that
just by looking at the classroom
that online learning can be kind of this Vulcan or Borg reality where kids are just on computers and learning , and in their isolated places , but done well , it can be highly , highly interactive
the teacher 's able to form good connections with the students
things
the types of frameworks
The points
just points
the way our brains are wired , or many of our brains are wired , things like points
just what 's known as extrinsic motivators , things that will hopefully motivate you to get more engaged
But the best motivators are intrinsic motivators ,
that the best thing to do is just build that learning
the most enriching thing of all
that 's what the points are
a growth mindset
" Well , I do n't really know "
the world , [E2]the people who are disproportionately successful
the world , [E2]the people who are disproportionately successful[/E2] successful are the people with growth mindsets
at ways that we could kind of scale that type of thing up
teachers , parents , older students
teachers ,[/E2] , parents ,[/E2] , older students
We 've recommended on our schedules that
I 've already mentioned it ,
that could be a great way to volunteer right now
there 's ways unrelated to Khan Academy that could be great to volunteer now
people who might not have a lot of connection to other people , get on Hangouts with them , talk to them , [E2]I[/E2] think people need that
if there 's elderly people in your area , offer to go buy their groceries for them , drop it off on their porches
that could be of great service
some of it
the concept
the video
remember , you could go to Khan Academy
Hey , so - and - so , it looks like " you have n't been working on it , " what 's going on ?

My son tried to log in " the other day and start where he left off " in algebra one , but it 's making him start " all the way back to the beginning
if your son was , maybe what you 're saying is maybe he left off in algebra one in his algebra one class
my advice to your son ,
he should take the course challenge in algebra one
where he is
through the material that 's covered in class
a good chance to review and refresh
him accelerate
from there
once he 's done with algebra one , he should continue on into geometry or algebra two , or whatever else interests him

An equation
they have depicted , let 's see , [E2]they[/E2] 're adding vector A to vector B
to vector B
vector A to the head of Vector B , you get vector C
that vector A plus vector B is equal to vector C
A
that vectors A+B , vector A plus vector B is equal to vector C
This choice , right over here
that vector B plus vector C is equal to vector A
this choice
Diagram or graph B
that vector B[/E2] B plus vector C is equal to vector A
that B+A is equal to C
which way you order them
B+A
The way they 've set it up , this is
one of the choices
the same thing as A+B
Instead of putting the tail of B at the head of A
Instead of putting [E2]the tail of B at the head of A
Instead of putting the tail of B[/E2] B [E2]at the head of A
the tail of B at the head of A
the tail of B[/E2] B [E2]at the head of A
at the head of A , [E2]they[/E2] just put the tail of A at the head of B
at the head of A[/E2] A , they just put the tail of A[/E2] A at the head of B
what order you are adding those two vectors
C+A or A+C
is C+A or A+C is equal to B
is [E2]C+A or A+C[/E2] A+C is equal to B

this exercise
off of the Khan Academy
graph a circle
according to its features exercise
a pretty neat little widget
a radius of 1
Y
the point 0 , 4
on it
X is 0
I 'm not there quite yet
along the X axis
X = -4
the X coordinate for the center
-4,1
The distance here
you go 4 then another 1 , it 's 5
a radius of 5
they asked us to do
what we have here in yellow as the general form of a p - Series
some visualizations
the graph , this curve right here , that 's Y is equal to one over X to the P
And [E2]we[/E2] 're saying it in general terms , because P is greater than zero
And we 're saying [E2]it in general terms , because P is greater than zero
it in general terms , because P is greater than zero , we know it 's going to be a decreasing function like this
it in general terms , because P is greater than zero[/E2] zero , we know it 's going to be a decreasing function like this
underneath [E2]that[/E2] curve , above the positive X axis
underneath that curve , above [E2]the positive X axis
the positive X axis , that 's is the integral
the positive X axis[/E2] axis , that 's is the integral
that this p - Series can be viewed as an upper Riemann approximation of that area
by that
The width
this would be the first term , in [E2]this[/E2] p - Series
this would be the first term , in this p - Series
an area of one
the X and Y scales are not the same
its ' area
one right over here ; [E2]its ' area[/E2] area would be one over two to the P
The area
one over three to the P
what this p - Series is
the area under the curve
our p - Series
now we 're not just talking about the white area , we 're also talking about this red area here
as a lower Riemann approximation of the curve
they fit under the curve , and they leave some area
if this converges , the same integral right over here , if this converges , [E2]it[/E2] goes to a finite value
if this converges ,[/E2] , the same integral right over here ,[/E2] , if this converges ,[/E2] , it goes to a finite value
if this converges , the same integral right over here , if this converges , it goes to a finite value
if this converges , the same integral right over here , if this converges , it goes [E2]to a finite value
well one plus that is still going to converge ,
well one plus that is still going to converge[/E2] converge ,
so this , or p - Series must also converge
so this ,[/E2] , or p - Series must also converge
to a finite value
just the integral test ,
the p - Series converges
to
under what conditions for what P does the p - Series converge
the integral from one to infinity , improper integral , of one over X to the P , dX this is the same thing , this is the limit as , I 'll use the variable M since we 're already using N , as M approaches infinity , and the integral from one to M of one over , and actually just let me write that as X to the -P
just the integral of one over X
the situation where P does not equal one , well there [E2]we[/E2] 're just kind of reversing the power rule that we learned in basic differentiation
So [E2]we[/E2] 'd increment that exponent , so it 'd be X to the negative P plus one
So we 'd increment that[/E2] that exponent , so it 'd be X to the negative P plus one
from one
to M
the limit
of natural log , of M
P equals one
the only part that 's really effected by [E2]the limit
the only part that 's really effected by [E2]the limit[/E2] limit , is the part that has M
the interesting thing about whether it converges or not
this part of the expression
in this situation
that P is going to be greater than zero
this integral
So there you have it ,
the exact
p
-
these exact same constraints
to our original p - Series
we diverge
The initial pH and the equivalence point
on the graph below
All right , so we have
the initial pH
2.54
29
it 's at a pH of
that in the last problem with equivalence , the equivalence point , or actually a couple of problems ago , the equivalence point was measured , the pH at the equivalence point was measured to be 2.54
that in the last problem with equivalence , the equivalence point , or actually a couple of[/E2] of problems ago , the equivalence point was measured , the pH at the equivalence point was measured to be 2.54
in , I think , the second part of this problem
the pH right over there , and then the half - equivalence point
half - equivalence point , [E2]we[/E2] 've added half the titrate
in the last part of the problem
the pH
to the half - equivalence point
with everything
your equivalence point
we go through these three points
something like that
the equivalence point ,
A disk
around a fixed axis
with angular speed omega nought
the magnitudes
which graph could show the angular velocity of the disk over time
in our horizontal axis here
how that changes over time
our initial angular velocity
the typical convention
that clockwise , clockwise is negative and counterclockwise would be positive
at a negative angular velocity
negative omega nought
F one
a torque
in the counterclockwise direction
our net torque is going to be positive
that means [E2]that[/E2] our angular acceleration is going to be positive
our angular acceleration
just the rate of change of our angular velocity
This one
that you 're starting off going clockwise , but then you 're accelerating in the clockwise direction
the direction that the net torque was being applied in
that you 're starting in the counterclockwise direction , which we know is not the case
that you 're starting in the counterclockwise direction
in the clockwise direction
a lot of talk about this thing called singular
Some teachers of mine
Rolando

as the plural third person pronoun
in English
sure their sources check out
for some of you
In French
for example
the vous form
in those languages

tu

Once upon a time [E2]the singular[/E2] singular second person subject form was thou
Once upon a time the singular second person subject form was thou
thee
The plural second person subject form
ye or ye
where you comes in , all right
from our video on who versus whom that I said whom was on its way out of the language
the same thing that 's happening [E2]to whom
to whom[/E2] whom happened to ye
Over the years its function decreased as " you " took over
a subject and object role as well as singular and plural functions
to that king
as "
all we have here
But something marvelous happened in English , the social distinction between you and thou fell away and you overtook thou and its subject form thee
But something marvelous happened in English , the social distinction between [E2]you and thou fell away and you[/E2] you overtook thou and its subject form thee
for both the singular and the plural , for the informal and the formal , for the subject and the object
you and thou fell away and you
It would be as if [E2]I[/E2] , me and we were all replaced by us
It would be as if I , me and we were all replaced by us
how revolutionary this is
the existence of a single form of direct address
class distinctions or prejudice in the English - speaking world

some form of glycolysis
But this seems , and these are n't the only things that we 've observed are common to all lifeforms
on cells as the basic units , which are bound by a membrane
these things
without having a common ancestor
all right , I can maybe buy that , that there 's this common ancestor right over here
to more structural evidence

circular chromosomes
chromosomes that contain introns
Introns
sequences of DNA that do n't code for genes that will then code into proteins
what the point of introns are
the reason why all of these have been classified together
that they have these similarities
that they would 've formed their own branch
based on how similar things are
at how different those sequences are to construct more and more precise trees like this
The polynomial expression , 36 y to the third minus 100y
as 4y times all of this , My plus g , times My minus g , where M and g are integers
Sally
that g could be equal to 3
Brandon
that g could be equal to 10
36y
100y
as 4y times 9y squared
4y
One way to think about it
I wrote it[/E2] it with the 4y factored out , and then , the 100y , right over here , I wrote it[/E2] it with the 4y factored out , so it[/E2] it 's 4y times 25
a difference of squares
9y squared ,
the same thing as , that is the same thing as 3y
the same thing as ,[/E2] , that is the same thing as 3y
this right over here can be rewritten as 4y , which we factored out at the beginning
a tricky one

a look at this multiple choice question from the AP US History exam practice booklet
The language used in both excerpts
the influence of which of the following
the words that they 're using , their phrases
for the influence of one of these four ideologies
they both
about God and the relationship between slavery and Christianity
Douglass
Bible
about how slavery is against the Bible and against the idea of liberty
we can cross that one out
they both kind of talk about ideas of divinity , [E2]I[/E2] do n't think they 're interested in any kind of pioneering
American
we can get rid of that
Douglass is , if anything , he 's kind of saying that slavery challenges American nationalism
a nationalist view of the idea of liberty
I guess he talks about it then
that slavery is a sin and a shame
Hammond
with The Second Great Awakening
that is a good answer
that God would have liked , or would not have liked , slavery
their language
an interest in religion

a road in Arizona , [E2]you[/E2] see a lot of cactuses
a road in Arizona[/E2] Arizona , you see a lot of cactuses
It 's more precise
my feeling
that as fungus and cactus get more and more entrenched into English eventually these formal endings are going to fall away and we 're just gon na have this regular plural
this little chart to go over the six most common Latin and Greek irregular plurals that you 're going to encounter in English
a word like larva
the regular plural that will probably get more popular over time
larvas
the first one ,
antenna
antennae
the ending change from final -us to final -i ,
the ending change from final -us to final -i ,[/E2] , which we find in a word like fungus ,[/E2] , is [E2]the singular
a word like datum , which is a single unit of data
what 's going to happen instead is that datum is gon na fall away
the plural of that
indexes , but indices
Indexes
the informal regular plural
Nobody

the first thing [E2]that some of you might have realized
that some of you might have realized[/E2] realized is that your cell phone has to deal with sound waves
sound traveling through the air
other videos where we talked about sampling sound waves so that you can store it as digital information
that detection
depending what 's happening
that you 're on , let 's say a video call or you are having an actual phone call , the original purpose of phones
that amazing because the cell phone really has , it does n't transmit in a particular direction
that cell tower
electromagnetic waves
in a bunch of different directions
this cell phone
Hey , that 's the signal for me
sound waves
a big part of what 's going on with a lot of technology ,
light waves
a way to detect light waves
a way to take that digitized information and then generate light waves

on a scale of evolution where they had n't come as far as Anglo - Saxons
a biologist
to that specific graph that you 've drawn on
Earth
Nobody who 's alive on Earth today
for more or less time , since their last common ancestor
Pretty much anything ,
That bacteria
in this sense of absolute time
biology
for precisely the same amount of time
a great job
this , this distinction between evolving from a common ancestor
that the actual theory of natural selection works
about it
as sort of , having three key ingredients
in order for these beetles , as a group , to evolve by natural selection
two different beetles
them different colors
variation
that those beetles , one of them is green and one of them is blue
differences in their DNA , that create the variation in colors
that this is something that their descendants could inherit
exactly it
the final ingredient
that , the differences , these heritable differences , need to affect how good the beetles are at leaving offspring in the next generation
that if they have blue beetles and green beetles , that one of those is gon na show up a lot better against the blue environment , than the other
an example of natural selection in action , where you can see that organisms that survive and , specifically , reproduce better , in a certain environment , are going to increase in frequency in a population
more and more of these blue guys
a great word there , which is adaptation
Adaptation
the word that biologists often give to the process of a population getting better and better suited to its environment
that the population was adapting to being in a blue space
that work

number of fans
a function that starts with practice time
for a choice that says , how does the number of fans that show up at a game how is that dependent on practice time , x ?
winning percentage as a function of average daily practice time
that one
The average number of fans per game

this choice where you input the number of rainy days from that you 're able to figure out practice time and then you input practice time to figure out win perecentage and then you input win percentage to figure out the number of fans in the crowd
what we 're doing
with daily practice time
this one a little bit , what I just did a little bit confusing I encourage you to try to set up a diagram like I just did in the beginning

the most basic , the most passive of the passive transports
straight up diffusion
a whole video on facilitated diffusion
that with the potassium ion channels , where potassium builds up on the inside of the cell because of the sodium potassium pump , let me just be clear , down here this is the inside , this is the outside of the cell , and then but then these channels allow the potassium to flow down their concentration gradient
just a simple tunnel
this is considered passive transport
it 's facilitated diffusion , passive transport
things to flow down their concentration gradient
the sodium
high concentration outside
, low concentration inside
passive transport
any energy
just about things flowing down their gradient
In active transport
energy
the best case of this
sodium having a high , [E2]it[/E2] establishes , it pumps sodium ions
sodium having a high , it establishes , it pumps sodium ions

which one of these could represent something that has a magnitude and a direction
The first choice right over here
the number 5
a magnitude , you could say , essentially , how large something is
all the information has
5 in a certain direction
This one by itself
the angle measure 5 degrees
a direction
it 's 5 degrees
it 's 5 degrees relative to the positive X axis
how far in that direction
a direction , but no magnitude
that the point is the end point of a vector that starts at the origin
the positive X axis
1,2,3,4,5
in the horizontal direction
that this represents the head of a vector who 's tail is at the origin
The vector
something like this
both a magnitude and a direction
the magnitude
You could solve using the Pythagorean theorem and the direction
this general direction
a magnitude and a direction
a vector
just 10
just a number
For the same reason ,
a number , [E2]that[/E2] could be a magnitude
a number ,[/E2] , that could be a magnitude

from our father and the egg cell , [E2]this is all happening inside of our mothers[/E2] mothers , the egg cell is from our mother
a cell that then differentiates into all of the cells of our body
the ovum is a gamete[/E2] gamete , the egg cell
So this right over here is a gamete
So this right over here is [E2]a gamete
a gamete
And as we 'll see , each gamete has half the number of chromosomes as your body cells or most of the somatic cells of your body so outside of your sex cells that might be in your ovaries or your testes , depending on whether you 're male or female

a big piece of information
if this is on both circles , then that means that this is B 's radius away from the point B from the center
that it is circle A
that this could be considered the radius for circle A
a distance formula
the distance formula tells us the radius right over here
just the distance between those two points
as negative 5 minus 0 squared
our change in x , negative 5 minus 0 squared
that the radius is equal to the square root of , this is 25 , this is 25 , 50

this distance right over here
5 times the square root of 2
this is just the same thing as the Pythagorean theorem
This distance

this is 0 minus negative 5
This distance right over here
the distance[/E2] distance between 0 and 5 in the y direction
Pythagorean theorem

to the nearest 100 , [E2]it[/E2] 's gon na go to one of these two
300
200
350
50 away from 300 , and 50 away from 400
to the nearest 100 , we would round down to 300
another way that you could do this , and it 's very similar to what [E2]we[/E2] thought about when we rounded to the nearest 10 , is okay
another way that you could do this , and it 's very similar [E2]to what we thought about when we rounded to the nearest 10 , is okay

to what we thought about when we rounded to the nearest 10 , is okay[/E2] okay , we 're rounding to the nearest 100
to decide on that , [E2]we[/E2] would go to the 10s place
in our 10s place right over here
less than five

it both
with what I just described
a four digit number
we have the number 7,652
about the 100s place ,
as seven thousands and six 100s
as 76 100s
which one would [E2]it[/E2] round to
to 7700
on a number line
7500
7600
7,600
7,700
7,650
to the right of right in the middle , [E2]we[/E2] would round up to 7700
982
82
900
100 that 's right below 982
that if we look at the 10s place , the eight is greater than or equal to five , so we are going to round up
100s
1,000
982 rounded to the nearest 100s
In the last video
through essentially the probability distribution for this random variable defined as the number of free throws
well , I too would enjoy graphing it , and we might as well do it together , because whenever you graph these things it makes it very visual , and kind of the shape of a binomial distribution like this

a little over 32 percent
10 percent
30 percent

kind of barely a showing
one percent
six percent

this whole video
just an exercise in making a histogram
a two - by - two , a , b , c , d
a lot of practice taking determinants of matrices like this
your original , the determinant of your original matrix , a , b , c , d
what I just did
ad minus bc
the determinant
instead of this being just a b
instead of this being just [E2]a b
a b , [E2]it[/E2] is now a kb
a b[/E2] b , it is now a kb
that look , if I multiply both of these rows by that constant k , how would that change things
kb times kc
you could factor out a k squared
to a generalized property that , if I have some n - by - n matrix A , then the determinant , the determinant of k times that n - by - n matrix A , the determinant of this , when I multiply a constant times all , entire matrix , I 'm multiplying that constant times all the rows , we could say all of the elements
this is going[/E2] going , this determinant
then [E2]this is going
this play out in a three - by - three case
a generalized proof for an n - by - n case
the whole point of this

Hey Sal , will there be summer classes ?
a lot of thought was no one had time to think about what the implications
summer
the silver lining of , historically summer has been , you know , there 's the term summer slide , it 's been a time for a lost learning and now we have an opportunity to do , now we have an opportunity to make it a valuable for learning purposes
next school year is going to be interesting
that the social distancing , the school closures are not in place as of
that the social distancing , the school[/E2] school closures are not in place as of

a question
about adding more subjects
there are places you can start
I actually think that you could
several , for example , even our high school biology
stuff
even in some of the early chemistry , high school chemistry units
on , what 's an element , what 's an atom , what 's an atomic number
this is super important

about getting this Khan Academy 's
a question on YouTube from Carmen Nita
that as we kind of get our legs under us that we can provide more and more supports for y' all
a small but mighty team
this is where the hybrid of in - person learning and having a great online tools that are accessible and free it 's starting to become even more important
Even before the crisis
about that everyone learns at different paces and has gaps in their knowledge if they 're pushed together at a fixed pace
students who come into a class on day one
35
all of us at Khan Academy
even before the crisis
with teachers and districts
with districts
one of the new normals is the emphasis on being able to blend is going to be really important , blend so that you can accelerate outcomes during a normal school year , but also blend so that if for whatever reason there 's a school stoppage that kids can keep learning and then the district and the teachers can keep monitoring
there 's a whole other layer that 's going to be really interesting around , you know , I 've been talking to some school districts lately , they 're doing all sorts of training to help teachers start teaching on Google Me or on Zoom
that 's gon na be a new muscle that even when schools are in session , I think might actually be an added muscle that 'll be really powerful for a lot of types of schooling
one of the biggest question questions that everyone 's thinking about is access
internet access

, yeah , no I mean , you know , I think [E2]not to get to a metaphysical or too deep , we find ourselves in this big mystery
that I know the purpose of life
that sometimes in your moments when you can actually steal your thoughts and bring your mind away from , I guess you could call it material reality and all of the distractions and material reality , sometimes you can feel a deep peace and connectedness to the universe and whatever you might want to call that
that actually can sometimes make you feel a very grounded and very happy
as a purpose of life

the rate law for the overall reaction
by writing the rate law for this elementary reaction that makes up step two of our mechanism
by writing the rate law for this elementary reaction[/E2] reaction that makes up step two of our mechanism
our rate constant
we can write the rate of reaction is equal to for step two
K2
K2 ,
by the concentration of our two reactants , which would be the concentration of NOBr2 , and the concentration of NO
by the concentration of our two reactants ,[/E2] , which would be the concentration of NOBr2 ,[/E2] , and the concentration of NO
the coefficients
in terms of the concentration of our intermediate , NOBr2
some way of substituting N for the concentration of NOBr2
by assuming that the first elementary step in our mechanism comes to a fast equilibrium
the first step comes to a fast equilibrium , we can use the Pre - equilibrium Approximation
the first step comes to a fast equilibrium , or a pre equilibrium , we know at equilibrium , the rate of the forward reaction

The rate constant for the forward reaction
K1

NO and Br2
K1 times the concentration of NO , times the concentration of Br2
the coefficients in our balanced equation are both ones for these two reactants , [E2]we[/E2] can raise the power of these two concentrations
the coefficients in our balanced equation are both ones for these two reactants , we can raise the power[/E2] power of these two concentrations
to the first power
this rate of the forward reaction
The reverse reaction
a rate constant of K minus one
K minus one times the concentration of NOBr2
both sides of the equation
by K minus one
K minus one
on the right side
that the concentration of our intermediate NOBr2 , is equal to K one
for the concentration of our intermediate
That gives us the rate of reaction is equal to
this K2
everything in all of this
everything [E2]in all of this
in all of this in for the concentration of our intermediate
in all of this[/E2] this in for the concentration of our intermediate

about what we would get if we multiply two constants together and then divide by a third constant
another constant , which we could just call K
K
the rate constant for the overall reaction
we have the rate law for the overall reaction is equal to K ,

this function that 's equal to 2 minus 8x squared plus 32x to the fourth minus 128x to the sixth
as an infinite series
a way that we can express this
each successive term
in order for it to be a geometric series
32
x squared
x squared[/E2] squared times [E2]x squared[/E2] squared is x to the fourth
that times negative 4x squared
like an infinite geometric series on the right - hand side
f of x
f of[/E2] of x
as being equal to the sum from n equals 0 to infinity of
2 times 1
to that , [E2]you[/E2] 're gon na add it to when n is equal to 1
the sum of an infinite geometric series like this
a non - infinite geometric series way of expressing this function
x is , [E2]it 's always going to be not[/E2] not , x squared
it 's always going to be not
that x squared needs to be less than 1/4
1/2
At 1/2
at negative 1/2
for lower absolute values
what this interval right here says
Another way to think about it
the absolute value of x needs to be less than 1/2
an interval over which this infinite geometric series will converge
this has a radius of convergence of , let me write it this way , radius of convergence , convergence of 1/2 , you can go 1/2 above 0
the interval over which we converge
that this is not so easy to solve
The way that I would at least attempt to tackle it
you would say this is two to the x squared minus three is equal to x to the , I could rewrite this , this is one over x to the 1/3 , so this is x to the negative 1/3 power
by raising both sides to the negative three power
if I raise something to an exponent , then raise that to an exponent , I could just multiply the exponents
two to the negative three x squared plus nine power
both of these terms
times negative three
Negative 1/3 times negative three
just 1
But [E2]we[/E2] have other tools
But we have other tools
things like computers , we can graph things and they can at least get us really close to knowing what the solution is
we can do that[/E2] that is we can say
another that was y is equal to one over the cube root of x
each of these
two to the x
another way to think about it
they 're going to intersect at an x value , where these two expressions are equal to each other
on Desmos
, this is our two sides of our equation
we have two ,
in this yellowish color
y is equal to g of x
over this
that the x value , right over here it looks like it is happening at around , let 's see this is 1.5 , and each of these is a tenth
this awfully close to 1.66
the whole point here
that , even when it 's algebraically difficult to solve
You can set this up as , hey let 's make two functions , and then let 's graph them and see where they intersect
a solution to that equation
that hey , the x value , the x solution here is roughly 1.66
In the last couple videos
about the local linearization of a function
how you think about the local linearization
quadratic approximations , and these
to the next level
they look like graphically
instead of having a plane that 's flat
instead of having [E2]a plane that 's flat
a plane that 's flat , [E2]you[/E2] have a few more parameters to deal with
a plane that 's flat[/E2] flat , you have a few more parameters to deal with
It 's still going to be simpler in terms of formulas
if [E2]you[/E2] want to think graphically what a quadratic approximation is , you can basically say if you slice this surface , this kind
that by hugging the graph very closely this approximation is going to be , well , it 's going to be even closer , because near the point where you 're approximating you can go out , you know , you can take a couple steps away and the approximation is still going to be very close to what the graph is , and it 's only when you step really far away from the original point that the approximation starts to deviate away from the graph itself
So a linear function which , you know , one that just draws a plane like [E2]this[/E2] , in terms of actual function what this means , so kind of a linear , this is going to be some kind of function of x and y
So a linear function which , you know , one that just draws a plane like this , in terms of actual function what this means , so kind of a linear , this is going to be some kind of function of x and y
sort of the basic form of linear functions
d times x squared
two y
what you would call your quadratic terms
this gives us a lot more control because previously , as we tweaked the constants a , b , and c , you 're able to give yourself , you know , that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space
this gives us a lot more control because previously [E2], as we tweaked the constants a , b , and c , you 're able to give yourself , you know , that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space
, as we tweaked the constants a , b , and c , you 're able to give yourself , you know , that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space , and if you choose the most optimal one you 'll get one that 's tangent
, as we tweaked the constants a , b , and c , you 're able to give yourself , you know , that gives you control over all sorts of planes in space[/E2] space , and if you choose the most optimal one you 'll get one that 's tangent

with the two
Relatively prime
they do n't share any factors in common other than one
about function inverses a little bit more , or whether functions are inverses of each other

Paige
a simple sentence
just what it says on the tin
A simple sentence
of one subject and one predicate
our one predicate
all of this together
what we call an independent clause
a compound sentence
two or more simple sentences joined together
two subjects plus two predicates
a very long sentence to read
the beach
two sentences together , joined by the comma and
our subject , I visited the beach , I got a really bad sunburn
our two predicates , I visited the beach , got a really bad sunburn
the subject in both these cases
I right , but it 's sort of separate
like , I 'm doing two different actions
at this
you do n't have
That whole thing , visited the beach and got a really bad sunburn
That whole thing [E2], visited the beach and got a really bad sunburn
, visited the beach and got a really bad sunburn[/E2] sunburn , is you 're right , it is a compound predicate
, visited the beach and got a really bad sunburn , is [E2]you 're right[/E2] right , it is a compound predicate
I visited the beach , and that could be a sentence on its own
one predicate
a compound subject or a compound predicate

The course
with the lesson Getting to know Khan Academy
a little about our commitment to high quality education , and the learning experience we hope to provide
the lesson Setting up you teacher account , which covers the main teacher functions , setting up classes , an overview of Khan Academy content , and a walkthrough of the student experience
The third lesson , Introduction to mastery learning
a broad overview of mastery learning
This lesson
a cursory look at Khan Academy 's progress reports
In this lesson
further into the logistics of using Khan Academy with students including our recommended implementation model , classroom best practices , and student motivation
with a next step section that explores the different opportunities for further education so you can continue to learn and innovate in your classes
in order to complete the course

Musa
20 students
for each of those students
how much caffeine they consumed and how much time they spent studying
these data points
into a computer
a least - squares regression line
from trying to minimize the square distance between the line[/E2] line and all of these points
information on that least - squares regression line
the most valuable things here
what we get in this column
The constant coefficient
essentially what is the y - intercept here
the slope
how well our least - squares regression line fits the data
how much of the variance in the y variable
a very good fit
none of it can be explained
the standard deviation of the residuals
another measure of how much these data points vary from this regression line
the standard error of the coefficient
the coefficient that we really care about
the coefficient that we really care about[/E2] about , [E2]the statistic that we really care about[/E2] about is the slope of the regression line
the standard error for the slope of the regression line
as the estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the slope of the regression line
a different sample , you will likely get a different slope
this slope
an estimate of some true parameter in the population
well the probability , if we would assume that , is actually quite low
about a 1 % chance that you would 've gotten these results if there truly was not a relationship between caffeine intake and time studying

kind of the headline or the cliff notes version of what CRISPR is and why it 's important
kind of the headline or the cliff notes version of what CRISPR is and why it[/E2] it 's important
the CRISPR system in action
a protein that purple blob with a little zip code molecule in it a piece of RNA that allows binding to a 20 letter sequence in the DNA of a cell
the guide RNA marking the site and then DNA getting cut
the T activity of CRISPR
in the example
in the example , [E2]we[/E2] just saw in the video
genes
in ways that were previously very difficult or impossible
systems everything else is
All living systems
these long sequences of DNA , parts of them
individual genes that can code for proteins
all
a technology that can help us edit DNA
on you
that something like this could happen
a technology that came out of a fundamental curiosity driven project
small science
science being done by a handful of laboratories
in our own lab at University of California , Berkeley
CRISPR , which was originally discovered to be a bacterial immune system , a way that bacteria can detect and destroy viruses
well , how does that work
about CRISPR
for some time
for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
it would use those as kind of [E2]that[/E2] tagging location sequence the way that you just described in that previous visual to kind of cut viral DNA
it would use those as kind of that tagging location sequence the way that you just described in that previous visual to kind of cut viral DNA
what it was doing
a system that works in real time
a bacterial cell
during an infection
a system that started as a fundamental biology project
how the CAS9 protein works as a DNA cleaver , [E2]we[/E2] could see how it could be harnessed as a genome editing technology
what 's taken off over the last eight years
at DNA sequences in bacteria
one of the first laboratories to realize that bacteria were acquiring DNA and storing it in their own genetic material in real time in response to viral infection , sort of a fascinating observation
at that time
a hypothesis that this might be some kind of immune system
At the same time
like a real niche area of biology
Watson
Crick
the moment
a one and a 1/2 page paper at the end I think they say something like it has not passed our attention ,
that moment
for you
Towards the end of the 2000s
on various different aspects of the CRISPR system and bacteria
in the work[/E2] work that we published in 2012 where we described the way that the CAS9 protein works as an RNA guided molecular scissors that can cut DNA at a desired place
as scientists
where the cutting happens
by programming it with these molecules of RNA
for us that was really the publication that , where we were able to point out that this could be used as a gene editing tool
sure I understand
your camera
you can move over a little bit I think to the right
, CRISPR is a cutter
, CRISPR is [E2]a cutter
a cutter , [E2]it[/E2] 's a cutting technology
a cutter[/E2] cutter , it 's a cutting technology
the actual genome editing
in the cell
in [E2]that[/E2] example that we saw
in that example that we saw
how in a cell , a broken piece of DNA
in truth
in textbooks
you believe that these proteins have brains of their own and they know exactly where to zero in on but these are these thermodynamic chemical systems where things are just constantly vibrating and colliding with each other
all of this random stuff
happening
how the enzyme and the RNA they 're part of this complex
At some point
into the right part of the DNA they cut
some of the DNA might repair
because of that
insertion of a new section of DNA or disruption of a small sequence such as a single base pair
a lot of people are able to extrapolate what this could do for better or for worse maybe in certain circumstances
the answer
that the vast majority of genome editing for people is going to be , in my opinion , certainly for the foreseeable future will be in adults or kids , but certainly not in embryos
Sickle cell disease
a well - known genetic disorder of the blood , that results from a single mutation in a gene that encodes one of this essential proteins for carrying oxygen in our red blood cells
CRISPR
with sickle cell disease
a way that therapy can be used in patients in a way where it impacts the patient , but not anybody else
The CRISPR protein and it 's guiding RNA
in different ways
as a directly assembled molecular complex of the protein and the RNA
the stem cells
And [E2]I[/E2] mean ,
of sickle cell which could be a very bad disease
directly to an embryo
the gene pool
one question
is , is that doable
the puts and takes there
a whole organism , like a whole human being
the reason [E2]that that is in my view a much more profound use of CRISPR
that that is in my view a much more profound use of CRISPR[/E2] CRISPR is that it creates what we call a heritable change in the DNA
not just the individual , but all of their kids
that there might be cases where that would be desirable
right now , for many reasons some of them are technical
most scientists feel that that is not an appropriate use of CRISPR in humans right now
on somatic cell editing
to , I remember being at a conference and someone was talking about this
there are already people being treated for sickle cell because of this
there will be many more to benefit in the future
he 's referring to is you can edit one gene
that scientist was put in prison because of the questionable ethics of this
Who do [E2]you[/E2] think should decide it
Jeffrey
this type of thing
the situation with CRISPR is in a way analogous to what we see for a number of types of technologies whether they 're in the biological sciences or in technology computing with for example , artificial intelligence where the question is the technology is powerful
those risks and who decides about uses
kind
in the end
all of us
a way to start is by engaging the scientific community globally to think about this and work on it together
a very good framework for using CRISPR in different settings going forward
obvious initial targets for CRISPR
The big challenge
the challenge[/E2] challenge of delivery which means how do we get the CRISPR molecules into the cells that need editing
in many ways
where the bottleneck is right now in the genome editing field
in terms of the next maybe near term targets for CRISPR
other blood disorders will be addressed as well as diseases of the eye
in the not too distant future
therapies for muscular dystrophy coming along
in terms of my own research
in this challenge of delivery
that for me as a scientist I really wanna see this technology be affordable and available to everybody around the world that needs it
a tall order
us to understand one of main things where we 're so afraid to edit gene genetics is because it 's such a complex system
an incredible tool
that we can now manipulate genes and understand gene functions in ways that previously would have been very difficult or in some cases impossible really to figure out
science
the right career for me
my own students ,
if [E2]it[/E2] 's biology that
if it 's biology that
for me
chemistry
in those early days
for myself
that by really following my own kind of gut feelings about things what I felt really passionately excited about studying , that has always led me in interesting directions
maybe in my last question I am curious
that that insight
us to harness it as a powerful technology
an incredible experience
a scientist and why I think [E2]it[/E2] 's such a wonderful career for students that are thinking about this , it 's a way to continue to have the kind of curiosity driven passions that you have when you 're growing up and you get to as a scientist people still pay me to ask questions and try to figure out how things work
a scientist and why I think it 's such a wonderful career for students that are thinking about this , it 's a way to continue to have the kind of curiosity driven passions that you have when you 're growing up and you get to as a scientist people still pay me[/E2] me to ask questions and try to figure out how things work
a fun career
the energy
it makes sense 'cause you are literally changing the world
for anyone who 's followed what 's been going on in biology and chemistry over the last several years
a big deal
all of y' all
copper sulfate
an ionic compound
The copper
two electrons
to the sulfate
the copper
a positive 2 charge
a cation
an anion
it 's very easy to dissolve it in a polar solvent like water
an aqueous solution
in water
one way to think about it
this is a bunch of copper cations dissolved in water and a bunch of sulfate anions also dissolved in this water right over here
solid zinc
is going to happen
positively charged coppers
nothing more than to take some electrons and become neutral
a redox reaction where the copper takes electrons from the zinc
neutral solid copper
the zinc
those electrons
to the copper
zinc cations
as zinc sulfate dissolved in the aqueous solution
what will [E2]this[/E2] actually look like
After the reaction
Zinc sulfate
a clearish looking liquid
zinc sulfate
a clearish liquid
instead of having solid zinc here
a neutral oxidation state
no charge
with zinc that has a positive charge
in the aqueous solution
Each ion of copper
with neutral copper in the solid state
that the copper
that the sulfate , its charge did n't change
the oxidation state
its actual charge
with the following two questions
of electrons per second
current 's going to measure the first one , and the electric potential energy of the electrons
they said it was a variable power source
our adjustable power source
a couple
a power source where this is the positive end , this is the negative end , and then let me make my circuit before any measurement tools
the measurement tools
there 's actually several
one where I do a little bump
our incandescent lightbulb
our power source
an arrow
across it
that it is a variable power source
a circuit that I 've just set up
some ammeters and voltmeters
in order to measure what 's happening as our electrons are going through the lightbulb
the current , you would denote it , the convention
in general
that the current goes from the positive direction
the first question
do you have a different number of electrons moving per second before entering the lightbulb
The way [E2]we can measure the current on either side[/E2] side of the lightbulb
we can measure the current on either side
some space
one ammeter
another ammeter
ammeter
current
on either side
about the voltage drop
a voltmeter
the voltmeter
the voltage drop
my diagram
my description , I could say I 'd put two ammeters in series with bulb
electrons per second entering and exiting
the current is the same
rate of electrons is different[/E2] different , then rate of electrons passing
then the [E2]rate of electrons is different
the first part , the first statement , to try to go for this first statement for statement one
fewer electrons
In one second
the bulb
different currents , well then [E2]you[/E2] 've got different numbers of electrons
for statement two
for [E2]statement two
statement two , so let me write [E2]this[/E2] , this is statement one
statement two[/E2] two , so let me write this , this is statement one
my procedure
for statement two , statement one test
you guys get the idea by this point
with , let me write it out , with bulb
If measures voltage drop
the statement
electric potential energy of electron changes
part A
the current entering and exiting the lightbulb
different electrons per second
the electric potential energy across the lightbulb
that means [E2]that[/E2] the potential energy is changing from one side of the bulb to another
I will , well , actually , [E2]I[/E2] think I answered part B too
parts A and B
A plus B
the diagram
depending on how your time pressure is
that an enzyme helps catalyze a reaction
the reaction[/E2] reaction , the enzyme
After [E2]the reaction
the substrate being broken up , in this case at least , into two smaller molecules
one of them
the other one
from the active site
the reaction is catalyzed , [E2]they[/E2] do n't have the affinity to the active site
this enzyme
about competitive inhibition
So the classic case of competitive inhibition
So [E2]the classic case of competitive inhibition
the classic case of competitive inhibition
our enzyme
And we 've already seen [E2]that[/E2] this is right over here where I 'm circling
And we 've already seen that this is right over here where I 'm circling
the active site
in classic competitive inhibition , or at least the version I 'm just gon na show [E2]you[/E2] right now
in classic competitive inhibition , or at least the version I 'm just gon na show you right now
another molecule that let 's say it looks something like this that can compete for the active site and if it gets to the active site first , so if it gets there first , let me show what 's going to happen
that they are competing for the enzyme , and in this case , they 're competing for the active site
the only form of competitive inhibition
Another form of competitive inhibition
allosteric competitive inhibition
allosteric
trouble writing
an allosteric site
a site
in allosteric competitive inhibition
a scenario where the competitor does n't bind to the active site but binds to a site that is not the active site , an allosteric site you could say
the competitor
in that one
to the active site
the same effect
So in this scenario , if the substrate is able to get to the active site , well then the competitor ca n't bind , so
the competitor , whoever gets to it first
the active site[/E2] site , if the competitor gets there first , the intended substrate is n't gon na get there , the reaction
the active site , [E2]if the competitor gets there[/E2] there first , the intended substrate is n't gon na get there[/E2] there , the reaction
that 's true of whether you 're talking about competitive inhibition where they 're competing for [E2]the active site
that 's true of whether you 're talking about competitive inhibition where they 're competing for the active site
if the competitor gets there
this situation where because the substrate got there first , the competitor is n't going to be able to bind to the active site
for the enzyme
By binding to an allosteric site
the conformation of the enzyme
this point
the whole next video on non - competitive inhibition[/E2] inhibition , [E2]in non - competitive inhibition[/E2] inhibition , the inhibitor right over here
in non - competitive inhibition
only one of the substrate or the inhibitor
In competitive inhibition
a quote by a physicist as a comment on one of his experimental results
about his experiment
It was as if you
Rutherford
at the time
a lot of research on radioactivity
a lot of studies looking at the different kinds of reactivity
we have two protons in the nucleus , since it 's Helium , and it also has two neutrons
any electrons
a piece of radium
the lead box
a small hole in it
on one side
the alpha particles
at a piece of gold foil
that our alpha particles here , the alpha particles are the bullets that are coming out of our alpha particle gun , and gold foil is our tissue paper
these pretty fast and massive alpha particles that we 're shooting at it
that to happen here
where we , we being scientists way back then , knew that J
Thomson ,
electrons
we knew the atom
we knew [E2]the atom
the atom , the atom had these particles in it that were small
the atom[/E2] atom , the atom[/E2] atom had these particles in it that were small
the atom[/E2] atom , the atom[/E2] atom had these particles in it [E2]that were small
that were small , that were really small , we knew that they were less than one percent the mass of a Hydrogen atom
that were small[/E2] small , that were really small[/E2] small , we knew that they were less than one percent the mass of a Hydrogen atom
they were negatively charged
Thomson
that electrons existed
based on his experimental results
it looking something like a chocolate chip cookie
these little negatively - charged particles that are stuck inside the atom
Scientists
that atoms were neutral
mathematical predictions on what the alpha particles would do
physics equations
depending on where the alpha particle goes through
you might see a little bit of deflection , but mostly , they should go straight through
we started with a spoiler , 'cause we know that he did n't quite get what he expected
what exactly
almost all the particles go straight through
a couple of them be deflected a little bit
that this is what an atom looks like
a very thorough chemist
that for every one in
the particles hit the gold foil and bounce back
his experimental results
that it had to be tiny because not very many alpha particles interacted with it , 'cause most of them went straight through
that it had to be massive and positively charged
a new model of the atom that incorporated these requirements
it 's really tiny
what else
our electrons
the rest of the atom
the electrons are really small and the nucleus only takes up 1/10,000 of the radius , the rest of that space
just nothing
Rutherford called this particular model , or we call it now , I 'm not sure
Rutherford called this particular model , or we call [E2]it[/E2] now , I 'm not sure
a pretty good picture of what was going on on the level of the atom
in this video
what we learned about the multiplier and the marginal propensity to consume
the builder
X dollars goes to [E2]the builder
the farmer
this much money
the marginal propensity to consume squared
so [E2]he[/E2] 's gon na get this amount
X plus X times the marginal propensity to consume plus X times the marginal propensity to consume squared ,
goes on
If we want , we can factor out an X , so X times one plus marginal propensity to consume plus marginal propensity to consume squared on and on and on , and you might recognize from your algebra class , or maybe your pre - calculus class that this is an infinite geometric series that we cover in other videos , and you can actually sum this up
If we want , we can factor out an X , so X times [E2]one plus marginal propensity to consume plus marginal propensity to consume squared on and on and on , and you might recognize from your algebra class , or maybe your pre - calculus class that this is an infinite geometric series that we cover in other videos , and you can actually sum this up
one plus marginal propensity to consume plus marginal propensity to consume squared on and on and on , and you might recognize from your algebra class , or maybe your pre - calculus class that this is an infinite geometric series that we cover in other videos , and you can actually sum this up , [E2]it[/E2] 's one of the cooler things in mathematics
one plus marginal propensity to consume plus marginal propensity to consume squared on and on and on , and you might recognize from your algebra class , or maybe your pre - calculus class that this is an infinite geometric series that we cover in other videos , and you can actually sum this up[/E2] up , it 's one of the cooler things in mathematics
as being equal to one over one minus the marginal propensity to consume
that initial expenditure of X
the multiplier
this is positive
that means [E2]that[/E2] the government is getting money , and money 's being taken away from the farmer
that means that the government is getting money , and money 's being taken away from the farmer
The amount I take away
the marginal propensity to consume
X is equal to this thing right over here
And some of [E2]you[/E2] might have seen something where the denominator looks different
And some of you might have seen [E2]something where the denominator looks different
something where the denominator looks different , you might see something called an MPS , or marginal propensity to save
something where the denominator looks different[/E2] different , you might see something called an MPS , or marginal propensity to save
why this thing
like this , where they write the negative of the marginal propensity to consume over , instead of one minus the marginal propensity to consume , they write the marginal propensity to save
MPS ,[/E2] , MPC ,[/E2] , people
MPS , MPC , people
it all seems so cryptic ,
did this come from

They 're going to travel less
they 're going to go to restaurants less
we 're for sure in a recession already and unfortunately the question is , how bad will it be ?
if you are diligent and you look for things and you look for things that have a good thesis and a thesis that can do well in any type of economy , you might find some diamonds in the rough , so to speak

good questions and comments
what my thinking was when I was maybe your age

when you come from fairly humble circumstances , I do n't think you oftentimes even allow yourself to go into a field that might be viewed as a little less than practical
that was definitely one of the constraints for me
this sounds like very pragmatic advice
about computing
something like accounting is kind of , that 's been counting , et cetera

An individual
the ability to activate B cells and mount a humoral immune response
B cells
just as a reminder
the ones that will recognize an antigen , something that the body
a faster response
No , no antibodies , bodies will be produced , so no humoral immune response
no memory B cells
The whole point of B cells and the antibodies
that the second time it shows around , it gets tagged very quickly
the B cells
all about the humoral immune response
about tagging things with antibodies , having the memory B cells around so that the next time you get the pathogen , the second exposure , you have a quicker response
the only part of our immune system
Our immune system
many facets to it
things like phagocytes that will go and engulf , that will engulf the pathogens
T cells that can recognize the antigen
the cell mediated immune response
things like the skin , things that just block pathogens from entering your body
into more detail
a high degree of confidence that something is about to happen
this is imminent
it was imminent
the uncertainty of , well , maybe it happens in the future
it as it 's written
Americans
that an energy crisis could happen imminently in the future
kind of the weird contradiction of something both being imminent and maybe happening
Something 's about to happen imminently
the future
that an energy crisis will be imminent and happening soon
just like B
the same thing as it 's happening soon
that an energy crisis is an imminent thing
more of the verb tense that I 'm a little concerned about
about something in the past

that the Axis powers , in particular , Hitler , are feeling pretty confident
that they have a pact with the Soviet Union
a very , very , very bold move

a major conflict with the Chinese
it 's imperial muscles
the Japanese , they want to have their imperial ambitions
especially now with this oil embargo , they probably want to take over more natural resources and they probably want to knock out the US or at least keep the US on its heels so the US ca n't stop Japan from doing what it wants to do

as spheres
these are the cross sections of those spheres

along the page
a standardized test , this could become a very involved thought process
a distance of 22
between two points
on these two surfaces
the largest of all of your possible choices
with the largest of all of their possible choices
a pretty good clue that that is the maximum possible length of PQ
in a future video

something that seemed weird
PQRS
a rectangle
The area of triangle RST
RST
the area of triangle PQRS
the area of triangle RST is seven
the area of triangle RST
given these lengths right over here
the base of RST
the length of segment ST times the length of segment RS
is equal to 14
Two times 1/2
Two times seven
this first piece of information
that the product of ST and RS , ST and RS is 14
that 's [E2]that[/E2] length right over there
that 's that length right over there
PS
the second piece of information
So I can write ,
here we know PT
an expression with ST , RS , and 14
in pretty good shape
ST
to PS
for ST
the PT
for us , [E2]we[/E2] can also substitute out the PT for something in terms of PS
for us , we can also substitute out [E2]the PT[/E2] PT for something in terms of PS
what this does
all the

we get
I think we deserve a drum roll now
the product of PS and RS being equal to , let 's see , what 's 14 times five
a bunch of structures
about each of these structures
about a singular subject
If they said all of these structures ,
a plural subject
each of these structures was the tallest in the world at the time they were built
a singular subject , singular verb , that makes sense
the figure above[/E2] above , the seven small circles , which have equal radii , and the large circle
the figure above , the seven small circles , which have equal radii , and the large circle
at the indicated points
the area of the large circle
that area is equal to pi r squared
that 36 pi is equal to pi r squared
the radius of the larger circle[/E2] circle , I 'll swap the two sides , the radius of the larger circle[/E2] circle squared
the radius of the larger circle , [E2]I 'll swap the two sides[/E2] sides , the radius of the larger circle squared
We could divide both sides by pi , divide both sides by pi , and we 're left with [E2]the radius of the larger circle
We could divide both sides[/E2] sides by pi , divide both sides[/E2] sides by pi , and we 're left with the radius of the larger circle
I 'll swap the two sides
that r is equal to plus or minus 6
the radius of the larger circle is six
the diameter of the larger circle is going to be 12
Diameter
twice the radius
that whole distance right there
the diameter of the larger circle
the diameter of the larger circle is 12
that means [E2]that[/E2] they each have a radius of two

In cellular respiration
The second
oxidation of intermediates in the Krebs cycle
the third one
formation of a proton gradient by the electron transport chain
high energy electrons
from NADH or FADH2
that it can phosphorylate these two ADPs to two ATPs
one contribution we could list
that it 's producing these NADHs
these NADHs , which can provide both the hydrogen proton and , more importantly , the high - energy electrons for the electron transport chain later on
that , well , look , it 's producing the Acetyl - CoA , which can enter the Krebs cycle , which is used to produce GTP or more NADHs or FADH2
all of these
contributions
the phosphorylation , phosphorylation of two ADPs , two ADPs , to two ATPs
several more
these NADHs
in the electron transport chain
about the NADHs or FADH2s
reduction of NAD plus
to NAD , NADH , which is used in electron transport chain , in electron transport chain to pump hydrogen protons to get , to create proton gradient
about the GDP , the GT ( laughs ) , the GTPs being created
about the FADH2 being created
ATP synthase which creates ATP from ADP
they drive
ATP synthase , ATP synthase , which , which takes , we can say oxidatively phosphorylates

Many species
circadian rhythms " that exhibit an approximately 24 - hour cycle
the effect of light " on mouse behavior
by using a running wheel " with a motion sensor to record activity " on actograms , as shown in figure one
We have a picture of a mouse here that seems to be inactive , definitely not on the running wheel
even eyes closed
our actogram
the running wheel , " the activity
as a dark horizontal line " on an actogram
activity on the running wheel
we have the black line from hour 12 to hour 24 , [E2]that[/E2] means we are detecting activity on the running wheel and so we can assume that the mouse is active
for day two
adult male mice
For the investigation
in cages
in cages " in a soundproof room
Each mouse
with adequate food , " water , bedding material , and a running wheel
The activity data
in figure two
Each row
a 24 - hour period
actual data that we are recording
On day two
no activity
On day three
a little bit of activity
the opposite
a lot of activity on that running wheel
their activity on the running wheel
as before
The activity data under DD , " continuous darkness , " conditions
in figure three
for less than 12 hours
everything shifting up every 24 - hour period because they tend to be inactive for less than 12 hours
why you see this shifting pattern where every day the activity starts at roughly an earlier period
a perfect trend
every day we are starting activity at an earlier hour
our activity
at an earlier hour
The nervous system
a role in coordinating " the observed activity pattern of mice " in response to light - dark stimuli
light
transmit signal
to brain
signals
It re - see ( laughs )
it receives
do we know what a photoreceptor , a brain , and a motor neuron , I guess as related to this test
neurons that would stimulate
muscles , glands
that 's , we 've taken a decent job of describing the role of each of those
during light
the basic idea
The researchers
that the genetically controlled " circadian rhythm in the mice does not follow " a 24 - hour cycle
versus 12 hours inactivity under light , under , I could say , L12
us to figure out what could be the graph of the line , or the points on the graph all lie on which of the following lines
about any line , we could think about , "
Our slope
our change in our vertical - axis
here this is a slope of positive 10
our last choice , slope of negative 12
that the slope right over here is negative 12

Based on [E2]the graphs above
Based on the graphs above
a little super fast primer
of the concentration , [E2]I[/E2] 'll just say of the coloring
this is definitely not a zero order reaction
okay , " that looks like a zero order reaction
And I 'm not gon na go into it
a little bit of calculus and a little bit of basic differential equations
concentration
in a first order of reaction
in a first order[/E2] order of reaction
in a first order
coloring , coloring for short
a little calculus
that the natural log of the concentration of coloring with respect to , if you plot that versus time , is you 're going to get a line
this is a key
this is [E2]a key
a key , this is a key signature of a first order , first order reaction
a key[/E2] key , this is a key[/E2] key signature of a first order , first order reaction
a first order reaction
hey maybe this is a second order
about the reaction order with respect to bleach , not the food coloring
the student
In a second experiment
solutions of food coloring and bleach with concentrations that differ from those used in the first experiment
the solutions are combined , the student
that the reaction mixture reaches an absorbance near zero too rapidly
to no color
the problem[/E2] problem , the student

In order to correct [E2]the problem

the solution does n't want[/E2] want , [E2]the student does not want[/E2] want the solution to become colorless that fast
that makes sense
blue food coloring
well if [E2]it[/E2] 's getting clear too fast , well , if you add more food coloring well then it 's just gon na
the one that we like
more coloring , more coloring , results in higher initial absorbance
In another experiment , a student wishes to study the oxidation of red food coloring
In another experiment , a student wishes to study the oxidation of red[/E2] red food coloring
In another experiment , a student wishes to study the oxidation [E2]of red food coloring
in the spirit of that one
with red
of red food coloring , just in the spirit of that one [E2]I[/E2] 'll underline it with red , of red food coloring with bleach
of red food coloring[/E2] coloring , just in the spirit of that one I 'll underline it with red , of red food coloring[/E2] coloring with bleach
of red food coloring , just [E2]in the spirit of that one[/E2] one I 'll underline it with red , of red food coloring with bleach

of red[/E2] red food coloring , just in the spirit of that one I 'll underline it [E2]with red[/E2] red , of red[/E2] red food coloring with bleach
at the very beginning of this question
about this wavelength of light
you could say [E2]you[/E2] could lower the wavelength of light or the wavelength of light should be red part of the spectrum to match the red food coloring
ethene gas and unreacted ethanol
During the dehydration experiment
through the tube
into the water
The ethene
as a gas
to be clear , what they 're talking about , [E2]we[/E2] can go to the original setup that they gave us at the beginning of this problem
Some of that ethanol
into ethene
that we do n't have a perfect , we have a 60 - point - something percent yield
a combination of ethanol and ethene gas going through this tube
It cools down
through this water
it looks like we 're only seeing , or we 're primarily seeing , the ethene gas here
the ethanol gas
ethanol
Ethanol is polar
something like , so ethanol , ethanol and water will have hydrogen bonds
your oxygen
dipole
why
the graphs of the two functions
If you 're wondering why I 'm seeing minus two instead of plus two remember [E2]we[/E2] 're substracting , we 're subtracting G of X
If you 're wondering why I 'm seeing minus two instead of plus two remember we 're substracting , we 're subtracting G of X

calcium ions that have a positive two charge
For every calcium
two hydroxides
that we are balanced , one calcium , one calcium , two hydroxides
It 's very soluble
a nitrate salt , which are very soluble
about this
your calcium ions
some of you
hey , this looks kind of like an equilibrium constant , but if we were dealing with an equilibrium constant , we would divide by the concentration of the reactants
an equilibrium constant
, we have a block
as much of the ions as we can
into our solution
an equal amount that forms from the solution
by the concentration of the solid calcium hydroxide
The convention
you multiply both sides by that to get a solubility product , and that 's where the solubility product comes from
another video that
0.10 molar calcium ions dissolved
in the solution
that means [E2]that[/E2] we would have two x molar concentration , I could write it this way , concentration of hydroxide because for every , whatever the concentration of calcium ions , you 're gon na have twice the concentration of hydroxide because for every calcium molecule , you 're gon na have two hydroxide molecules
with this solubility product
this notation that I wrote here might be a little bit confusing
For every calcium [E2]you[/E2] add
For every calcium you add
twice as many hydroxides
1.3

this is going to be four x squared , and
the assumption you make
0.10
0.40
1.3 times 10 to the -6th is equal to 0.10 times four x squared
with how many significant figures are over here
what I got
our answer
that , you will see that that is actually the case
our lone pairs of electrons
a partially negative charge
us to draw four
those are oxygens right over there , and these are the hydrogens right over here
that end of the molecule
The hydrogens have a partially
The hydrogens have [E2]a partially
a partially , [E2]that end of the molecule[/E2] molecule has a partially positive charge
a partially[/E2] partially , that end of the molecule has a partially[/E2] partially positive charge
The proposal
what is being met with fierce opposition
about one proposal
one thing , you would n't use
if you 're talking about a singular thing that 's it 's happening to , that it 's being met with
this right over here , this verb
for plural
for if we had many proposals
it as is
an action for the proposal
with fierce opposition
a noun and then a pronoun to refer to the same thing
A single proposal
were met with
their fierce opposition
their
who 's [E2]their[/E2] referring to
about , this is ambiguous
This possessive pronoun their

When you walk into your classroom in the morning , you never think , " I 'm not gon na talk " to my students all day
for some of your students
the most important relationship that they have every day
students right now are really hungry for that opportunity for social connection and getting a note from you as a teacher , someone who 's so meaningful in their lives , telling them that you missed them and how excited you 'll be to see them again , it really has a deeper meaning
A lot of students
a bunch of work to do while they 're at home
that that work has meaning
a lot of teachers , maybe taking a sample problem

Is
the emotional impact , that everything that 's going around right now
Remote learning
about more than just curriculum
we 've seen a lot in the media over the past couple weeks
You as a teacher
that being a teacher[/E2] teacher is not just about reaching a standard
a question for discussion , or maybe just open reflection and , again , thinking back on some of the things we talked about earlier
an opportunity to reflect on the emotional toll that this experience is having on them
At a school I worked at
across the board
remote learning and that emotional piece is not just about the students
remote learning and that emotional piece is not just [E2]about the students
about the students , [E2]it[/E2] 's about you
about the students[/E2] students , it 's about you
we 've seen a lot about the effect it 's having on students
the team here at Khan Academy
this ties in , right , with recognizing the emotional piece

all of my social tabs
where my focus was
on your hangout or your video
hopefully what we 're seeing through this webinar today is what 's possible for your own students
a couple of things
into the platform
On every course for Khan Academy
that each of these offer kind of a gamification piece where students are earning mastery points for achieving progress on skills , lessons and units and so , as students work through content and I 'm gon na jump into a unit here
their levels go up and their skills move to mastered
mastery points and badges
that works for some students , and definitely not for all
again to the question of , " [E2]I[/E2] 'm not there in person I ca n't put my chart on my wall

What else
So ,
this comment from Linda , which was , " That I know , I thought I was the only one " who was feeling overwhelmed
Meaghan and I
former teachers , current parents with our own kids at home
you know your classroom and your students best , so please adapt in and do n't take this as a hard and fast rule but take it as general advice that you can adapt to your own teaching and your students learning styles
this unit
them do , one day
one day
probably at the end of the week
into course mastery
from this teacher dashboard
to placement
in the example you see on your screen
algebra one
to my whole class
that 's my class level goal and this shows up on the student dashboard for all of them ,
that 's my class level goal[/E2] goal and this shows up on the student dashboard for all of them ,
one to everyone , that 's my class level goal
one to everyone ,[/E2] , [E2]that 's my class level goal
instead of having to make an individual assignment for every skill they need to learn
the opportunity to reach mastery on all of those skills
all students
towards this grade level
And then , if [E2]you[/E2] have students who might need a little bit more support , maybe they 're working below grade level
And then , if you have students who might need a little bit more support , maybe they 're working below grade level
an additional goal
content across you know , math , science , computer programming , arts and humanities , and many others
on a first , second , grade level
the whole class
on mastery
the opportunity to think about how you might be able to alter that for special education students
progress
I can see here
how my whole class is doing in third grade
a quick snapshot of all of your class and how they 're doing towards that greater goal
each of the units within that overall course
a similar screen to what I saw for course mastery
a little bit more progress
By clicking the carrot on the left hand side
my students and how they 're performing on that particular skill
Attempted
they 've tried but they 've gotten fewer than 70 % of those questions correct
Familiar
they 've reached at least 70
, means they 've reached at least 70 , proficient is , means they 've got at least 100 % on an exercise which is single skill practice
, means [E2]they 've reached at least 70[/E2] 70 , proficient is , means they 've got at least 100 % on an exercise which is single skill practice
a sense of how you can keep tabs on your students , even when you 're all spread apart
pretty deep into the innards of Khan Academy
all the same questions
to students
the caveat
there 's different types of questions , so in this case you can see there is a number line question

For the actual test
for part b
whether the males from the outside , what age they were
well maybe one of the reasons for even part a is that you did n't have abundant resources , but notice when you introduce males from the outside , now all of a sudden , the population keeps increasing

that since the spring will be compressed twice as much as before , the block will have more energy when it leaves the spring , so it will slide farther along the track before stopping at position x equals 6D
the spring
all of that potential energy
into kinetic energy
the friction
against the motion of the block
the negative work
all of that kinetic energy
into heat
x equals negative 2D here
all of this potential energy
And what 's being said , or what 's being proposed , by the student is alright
we are going to go
instead of going to 3D
a question mark
in part ( b
) i
which aspects of the student 's reasoning , if any , are correct
part two
which aspects of the student 's reasoning , if any , are incorrect
, [E2]the student[/E2] student is correct that two times , so compressing more , compressing spring more , spring more , will result in more energy when the block leaves the spring , result in more energy when block leaves the spring , block leaves spring , which will result in the block going further , which will result , or the block going farther I should say , which will result in longer stopping distance
that potential energy is equal to 1/2 times the spring constant times how much we compress , squared
that energy , energy grows with the square , with the square , of compression of how much we compress it
two times compression
I 'll write it out
in four times the energy
in four times the stopping distance
that it does a decent job of explaining where the student is correct , where their reasoning is correct , and where it is incorrect
we wanna find f prime , [E2]we[/E2] could just take each of
we wanna find f prime , we could just take each of
the derivative of each of these terms
the derivative of[/E2] of each of[/E2] of these terms
with respect to x
if this is f , then f prime , and I 'm not gon na scroll down just so I can see this up here
We could just say f prime , f prime of x
Maclaurin
that a looked funny , Maclaurin series for f prime , f prime of x
just application of the power rule
us to write the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series
that is going to be equal to , so , I 'll write approximately equal to , because we 're one going to write the first four of terms of this infinite series , and
that is going to be equal to , so , I 'll write approximately equal to , because we 're one going to write the first four of terms of this infinite series[/E2] series , and
just to be clear what I did , I just did the power rule here , I looked at this exponent
That 's straight out of the power rule
one of the first things you 'll learn about taking derivatives
27
So there you have it
the first four nonzero terms of the Maclaurin series
the first part
these two things
So this right over here , you might recognize this , so I could write it like that , or I could also write it , if I start at n equals zero
as a geometrix series with common ration of negative , of negative three x
the sum of a geometric series with common ration
So our common ratio is negative three x
If what I just did here looks unfamiliar to you , I encourage you to watch the sum of infinite geometric series , and not only do we show you this formula
a pretty fun prove
an infinite geometric series
This is
we are going to
this equation where we have blue food coloring , which has this chemical formula , and it 's reacting with bleach , or hypochlorite , and it 's making colorless products
this color change from blue to colorless
a spectrophotometer set at a wavelength of 625 nanometers
these three graphs
at the concentration of A over time
at the ln of A over time , the natural log
the equation sheet
the part of the equation sheet that 's relevant for this problem
all of the equations that have to do with kinetics , which is looking at reaction rates
three possible things that might be helpful for this problem
the second equation , which gives us the second order integrated rate law
half - life is .693 divided by k , and that is the half - life for a first order reaction
the information we have
by looking at just the first graph
we can get a lot of information just by looking at the concentration of A over time
that this is not linear
the fact that it 's not linear
the fact that [E2]it 's not linear
it 's not linear[/E2] linear immediately tells us it 's not zero order
it 's not linear immediately tells [E2]us[/E2] it 's not zero order
zero order
some more information
by looking at this one graph
it 's not zero order
from this first graph
if it 's first order
that first order reactions , so for first order reactions , we know , and I 'd say this is maybe one of the most important things about first order reactions , is that half - life is constant
that means [E2]that[/E2] the time it takes for the concentration to go down to half of what it was , is the same no matter what your initial concentration is , no matter what point in your reaction you 're at
something we can actually investigate just by looking at this first graph
how much time it takes to get to half the concentration
at the half - life
in orange
.2
.1
from .2
to .1
the continuation of a pattern
the fact that half - life is constant based on Graph I
the fact [E2]that half - life is constant[/E2] constant based on Graph I
that half - life is constant
based on the equations that we have , or based on just equations you know off the top of your head
The other reason why we know this is first order
when a reaction is first order[/E2] order in your reactant , you know that graphing ln of your reaction versus time , gives you a straight line , and we can see from Graph II that this is the case
these two pieces of evidence , from Graph I and Graph II , that tell us that this particular reaction is actually first order with respect to the blue food coloring

maybe air around you , flowing in towards the origin here
maybe air around you [E2], flowing in towards the origin here
, flowing in towards the origin here , flowing out away from the origin there , it would kind of be rotating around here , and later on in multi - variable calculus , you 'll learn about various ways you can study just the function itself and just the variables and get a feel for how that fluid itself would behave , even though it 's a very complicated thing to think about , it 's even complicated to draw or use graphic software with , but just with analytic tools , you can get very powerful results

the formula for three - dimensional curl
by taking this upper - left component , and then multiplying it by the determinant of the sub - matrix , the sub - matrix whose rows are not the row of I
K , multiplied by the sub - matrix whose columns involve the column it 's not part of[/E2] of and whose rows involve the rows that it 's not part of[/E2] of , so K multiplied by the determinant of[/E2] of this guy
So we 're subtracting off partial derivative with respect to Z of
Nabla
our vector function , vector - valued function V whose components are P , Q , and R
to using this IJK notation
I typically default to column vectors and other people will write in terms of I , J , and K
One really quick thing [E2]that I wanna highlight before doing an example of this
that I wanna highlight before doing an example of this[/E2] this is that the K - component here , the Z - component of the output , is exactly the two - dimensional curl formula
what its formula is , [E2]that[/E2] is what we have here
all the other components
like mirrors of that

A block
at position x = zero , and in contact with an uncompressed spring of negligible mass
The block
along a frictionless surface
from position x = zero
to x = -D
that , right there , delta x is = to D
The block[/E2] block is then released at x = zero
The block is then released at x = zero
a rough part of the track
to work
the way until we get back to x = zero[/E2] zero , then the spring
when we let go , that potential energy is going to be converted to kinetic energy , and that block is going to be accelerated all [E2]the way until we get back to x = zero
that it 's going to come to rest at x = 3D , the coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the rough track is mu
the kinetic energy of the block and the potential energy of the block - spring system
spring
cause the work necessary to compress the spring that 's going to be the potential energy that you 're essentially putting into that system
our change in x
for this
you are , you 're going to end up with a potential energy of one - half times the spring constant
our change in x[/E2] x is D
our change in x is D
our potential energy 's going to be like once we 've compressed the spring by D
the potential energy
as a sqaure of how much we 've compressed the spring
the kinetic energy
at zero
if you , if you were to add these two curves at any position , you are going , their sum is going to sum up to this value
at that high kinetic energy
that the block comes to a rest at x is = to 3D
what type of a curve is this
as essentially doing this negative work
the key thing to remind yourself
is : is this is a plot of energy versus position , not velocity versus position or velocity versus time
energy versus position
the kinetic energy , k , of the block

The amino acid sequence of cytochrome c
for five different species of vertebrates
The table below
the number of differences in the sequences between each pair of species
about cytochrome c
a protein
for this question
the way to read this
for each of these rows you could say , all right , this[/E2] this row describes D
too many differences in the sequence of cytochrome c
a good number of differences from any of the other four
this chart
here , there 's only one amino acid difference , or one sequence
that these are fairly closely related
an ancestor not too far in the distant past
some low numbers
those are probably pretty closely related
who have [E2]we[/E2] not dealt with
with D
with the other four
a pretty big difference
ferus

at sequences of proteins , if I could look at what 's going on with the DNA , I like looking at that
this may be a better way to think about it
your slope
your rate of change of y with respect to x is equal to zero
in some way
another way to think about it that
you could say that[/E2] that your change
this little insight here on vertical lines
the curve of the equation
that y to the third minus xy is equal to two
the equation of our curve
that dy , dx is equal to y over 3y squared minus x
the derivative of y with respect to x
okay , at what x , y pair does this numerator equal to zero ?
okay , at what x , y pair does this numerator equal to zero[/E2] zero ?
3y squared minus x is equal to zero
another way you could have thought about it
well , at what x and y values does the derivative of y with respect to x become undefined
to the same conclusion
both of these constraints
if we take our original equation of the curve , we get y to the third minus
instead of writing x
3y to the third
we get y to the third[/E2] third minus
negative 2y to the third
Negative one[/E2] one to the third power

I can measure
resistance of bulb by voltage across bulb ,

this two - dimensional vector field V
when you describe the rotation , around each point what we were familiar with is 2D curl , that 's where you get this vector field

how really it 's just the same vector field kind of copied a bunch
in principal
that every one of those infinitely many slices of space has a copy of this vector field
in a formula
that Z is an input point as well
the fact that you have a Z
to the fact that all the slices are the same , as you change the Z[/E2] Z direction the vectors wo n't change at all , they 're just carbon copies of each other
the fact this output has a Z component , but it just happens to be zero
what corresponds to the fact that it 's very flat looking , you know , none of them point up or down in the Z direction , they 're all purely X and Y
this one is only barely a three dimensional vector field
that those inside this column , inside this sort of counter clockwise
for the moment
that original vector field
all of the vectors
Inside that column where we have that tornado rotation I was describing
in the positive Z direction
in this vector field , this one that was just kind of copies of a 2D put above
as a more loose and vague idea
okay , given that there 's some kind of crazy air current fluid flow happening around here , I can maybe understand that at a specific point , you 're gon na have some kind of rotation , and here I 'll picture it as if there 's like a ball or a globe sitting there in space , and maybe you 're imagining your new vector field and saying what kind of rotation is it kind of induce in that ball that 's just floating there in space ?
3D curl
one of the most complicated things in multivariable calculus that we have to describe
the key to understanding it is to just kind of patiently think through and take the time to think about what 2D curl is instead of thinking about how you extend that to three dimensions and slowly say , okay , okay , I kind of get it , tornados of rotation , that sort of makes sense
Like I said , [E2]it[/E2] is complicated , and it 's okay if it does n't sink the first time
Like I said , it is complicated , and it 's okay if it does n't sink the first time
one of the things that 2020 has taught us is , even in this moment of social isolation , how much we need each other , how much we need partners and collaborators in our lives
this year is about that more holistic idea of serving your students
Headspace
sure that their social and emotional needs are met , as well as your own as educators
Alice
more about that
in a little bit
In the meantime
the session
in true webinar fashion
as educators ourselves
a lot of you were interested in the Headspace swag bag ,
Just for being here live with us today
into a drawing for one of those five swag bags
Sam
As a parent
such a hard year
we thought [E2]we[/E2] 'd just , before I sort of introduce Sam , just to give you a little idea of what we 're going to cover today
this to be really practical
some simple exercises for you to use for yourself and for your students
with some Q and A
a wonderful introduction
an amazing human being
a teacher in the classroom
all of the things that I 'll be offering you
from a place of embodied experience
I 've tried them out
I 've [E2]tried them out
tried them out , [E2]they[/E2] 're tried and true methods for bringing mindfulness into your own life and also into your students ' lives
tried them out[/E2] out , they 're tried and true methods for bringing mindfulness into your own life and also into your students ' lives
us to start out actually with a practice
a couple practices
this little bell
about how anchors keep a boat , right , from drifting too far away
the waves , or if this is like our mind and our mind wants to follow different streams of thought , the anchor
more control over our attention
a foundational practice that you can do with your students
I do n't know you ,
in a car
with me
the first thing we start with
our body posture
your eyes
in this still posture
our mind is so busy
of the words breathing in , breathing out
Breathing
on it 's own
our breath
I 'm just curious
in the chat
one thing that you noticed
heaviness in my eyes
dreams of falling asleep or , you know , cravings to get in my bed and sleep
I believe [E2]I[/E2] can see-- A lot of folks are really sort of getting into this
Deanna
the tension in her neck
I noticed my head hurt a little bit
Emily
here we are in December , and I have a stuffy nose
anything you 're noticing , whether it 's pleasant , unpleasant , or neutral
mindfulness
the muscle that we 're trying to flex with ourselves and with our students
really good noticing
Another category
mental activity
our five senses
when we close our eyes like we just did , we might notice wind
the heater in my house
smells
another category
a memory of someone that you love that 's in your house
that you just thought , oh , I really like that person
how they 're doing
any , any of these , any of the stimuli from these different categories
during our practice
about how to bring this into your classroom , or how to practice it with your students , you can teach them about anchoring
about how to bring this into your classroom , or how to practice it with your students , you can teach [E2]them[/E2] about anchoring
a timer
for one minute
in their body , and think of the words breathing in and breathing out , they can practice in silence
with 30 seconds
at a minute
one practice
The second practice[/E2] practice I want to talk to you a little bit about
the stop practice
this is their favorite
for this activity
the feeling of our clothes against our skin
your students
up to you
each word
a student who was about eight years old
that when they had lost their dog , their dog had run away , the mom was getting frantic and panicky
her son said , mom , let 's stop
the sensation
through it
So I 'm not sure
if many of you have practiced before or not
with the busyness and the rush of your mind
at that point
the reality
that we 're facing the busyness , that rush , that speed of thought that reflects the speed of our lives
with whatever shows up in our practice
That willingness to be with things as they are
the relationship we have to our internal world
in the middle of the day , in the middle of our lives
a little bit about how our expectations really match up with with the reality of meditation and mindfulness
your familiarity with mindfulness
Sorry about that--
I 'm talking about
I never thought [E2]I[/E2] would teach it
your own reasons for being drawn to it
to the next slide
It 's a propensity [E2]we[/E2] have
a quick definition of it
that it[/E2] it 's our our ability to be present and attentive with openness , curiosity , and a kind mind
I did n't have my mindfulness skills , [E2]I[/E2] think I would have turned into someone that I did n't even recognize
a moment
just the acknowledgement of that sensation , that thought , that emotion
it to settle
us to stay resilient , and to meet our students with more calm , and to meet them with more bandwidth , which makes the teaching profession a sustainable one , instead of a , you know , one where you get burnt out in the course of a year or two
our physical health
our immune system
with longevity
studies
that it preserves , it keeps those telomeres intact for longer periods of time
tremendous health benefits , not to mention sleep
for our students
this tool to focus and to be able to regulate their attention
children I work with , who 's ever told you to pay attention , raise your hand
my follow - up question
who 's ever taught you how to pay attention
a tool for emotional regulation
a big one
educators
as many as apply
quite a few choosing the burnout , which is certainly topical tonight , the motivation piece which also fits in with what we 're talking about
the biggest ones here
a lot of students
that developmental period , that having restricted access to their friend groups is causing depression in a lot of them
life
And also just this , like what is , what is [E2]life[/E2] even for
when we 're thinking about how to address that from a mindfulness perspective , I think of the word compassion
this practice
in our Headspace for Educators group on Facebook
that some of the folks from the very first exercise we did said they had their dinner in the oven , the ratatouille was cooking in some cases
we 're at our end time
this Headspace for Educators group
on Facebook
if anyone wants to sign up , they can just go to our headspace.com landing page , forward slash educators , and all the information is there
Kelly
such a good question
I think [E2]I[/E2] would say to start with anchoring
Another one that we 'll feature on the Facebook group
loving kindness practice
a lot of material like that
on the app
the anchoring practice and friendly wishes are two really good practices that kids , once they learn them , they do say that they practice them on their own
in retrospect
that I did n't learn this when I was at that age , 'cause I feel like it 's such a foundation for a great life
Carol
if a student wants to practice
the sun
on my face
a deep breath
, I ask myself , what 's one thing I 'm grateful for ?
So that 's a very easy accessible practice for them to do
I think what [E2]I[/E2] 'm speaking to is the fact that it 's important to emphasize to students that one minute is enough
a reset button
a little spot , you know , maybe even in their bed
A lot of kids
the app and guided meditation
some recommendations
most kids have a bed of their own , and that 's like a sacred space for them
that 'll resonate
the sleep cast being used a lot by young people
the next couple of questions
about some of the resistance that educators have gotten trying to bring mindfulness into the classroom in the past
Mary and others
to the parental resistance , which sometimes is based in a religious sort of objection of , hey , does n't this sort of go against my own spiritual beliefs
any kind of complaints about that
from parents that you 've worked with
from parents that[/E2] that you 've worked with
in schools
for nonprofits
okay , I see that these kids need emotional regulation skills , so I 'm just going to do it
a parent withdraw her child from my group because of what you just said , these religious reasons
At the time
in my early twenties
a lot of religious practices
their own contemplative format
through prayer or in other ways
all over the internet
Jewish
some people I 've worked with who are ,
that it , actually , [E2]I[/E2] 've told some people I 've worked with who are , you know , devoutly Christian or devoutly Jewish , that these practices can actually enhance your connection to your religion
that it ,[/E2] , actually ,[/E2] , I 've told [E2]some people I 've worked with who are ,[/E2] , you know ,[/E2] , devoutly Christian or devoutly Jewish ,[/E2] , that these practices can actually enhance your connection to your religion
you go deeper into prayer , or connect with readings or teachings that you find so deeply meaningful in your life
just some suggestions of bridging that gap
that capacity
with practice
the sort of flip side to that question is from the student perspective
when I was a teacher , I would get lots of questions like , Mr
a student
With kids who are younger
more movement
A lot of classic games that we were taught [E2]as kids
A lot of classic games that we were taught as kids
as kids[/E2] kids work really well as a mindfulness teaching tool
as kids work really well as a mindfulness teaching tool
like red light
Simon says I use a lot
Simon says
the bell
about the benefits
with the kids
with the kids , with little , little ones
about attention , and about dealing with hard feelings
With older kids
a list
what they noticed
How many of you
all those feelings
at some point in your life
teens
that , like , a little bit about what 's going on in their brain at that age , where their dopamine
their highs are higher[/E2] higher , their lows
So [E2]their highs are higher
as teens
health class
the brain , regarding when it pertains to emotional regulation , largely gets neglected
a purpose and a connection to the practice
that ratatouille is getting very crisp in the oven
Kimberly
any tips for implementing all of this effectively , especially in a remote or online learning environment
how challenging this might feel even in person
resources
on the app we have , or even on YouTube
through the videos
that lesson and that theme
it to be fun
it to be a relief for us too
something we need as well
this gap between adults and children , adults , or teacher and student
this ritual
in our week
I think [E2]I[/E2] 'll actually give Danielle the last word here
thank you so much for your time , and creating this lovely space
so many other comments like that
throughout the session
there 's going to be a lot of more mindful classrooms and students , and educators , starting tomorrow morning
on behalf of the entire Khan community
Leno
Sam , Alice , Leno
the slides behind the scenes
for making this possible
One last little request of all the audience members before we go back to our ratatouille
you will get a three question survey that pops up right after the session
the fifth root of 32
with these really high order roots
One way
you could try to factor 32 and see are there factors that show up five times
two times eight
Eight
two times two
that this is two times two times two times two times two or two to the fifth power
as the fifth root of two
Two to the fifth power
243
we wanna take the fifth root of 243
the factoring
a little bit of trial and error
alright , it 's not divisible by two
the digits
81
a sense of where this is going now
three times 27 , which is three times nine
three times three
another way that you could have done it
that two to the fifth power
what three to the fifth is
four times four
16 times four
256
Times four
by hand
1024
what to the fifth power
another way
Metal - air[/E2] air cells
a relatively new type of portable energy source consisting of a metal anode , an alkaline electrolyte paste that contains water and a porous cathode membrane that lets in oxygen from the air
the negative terminal of our power source
the source of electrons
an alkaline electrolyte paste that contains water
that means [E2]that[/E2] it 's going to be basic versus acidic
An electrolyte
something that if you dissolve it in a polar substance , a polar substance like water , well then the solution is going to be good at conducting electricity
this electrolyte paste
something that 's good at conducting electricity
the electrons are going to
that oxygen is available in this membrane
Reduction potentials for the cathode and three possible metal anodes
in the table below
Reduction
the gaining of electrons
the potential to gain electrons
molecular oxygen reacting with water
For every molecule of molecular oxygen
two molecules of water
a reduction reaction
with the hydroxide
your electrons coming in
The electrolyte paste
water
The cathode is porous
a porous membrane - type substance
a porous[/E2] porous membrane - type substance
that , that reaction could happen right over here in the cathode
your electrons coming in on the wire ,
in a solution
part of that electrolyte paste that 's in water
the reduction potential
a positive potential
the fact [E2]that this is a positive voltage , so plus 0.34 volts
that this is a positive voltage , so plus 0.34 volts[/E2] volts means that the potential is going in this direction
The electric potential
this reaction to happen going from left to right
they also said [E2]they[/E2] give us the reduction potentials for the cathode , which we just talked about , this is the reduction potential for the cathode , and three possible metal anodes are given in the table below
zinc
This whole anode
out of metal zinc
for every molecule of that
two hydroxide anions that are dissolved in water
two hydroxide anions that[/E2] that are dissolved in water
what makes the electrolyte paste alkaline
into an electron source
Early forms of metal air cells
as the anode
the example we just thought about
For every two molecules of zinc and one molecule of molecular oxygen
For every [E2]two molecules of zinc and one molecule of molecular oxygen
two molecules of zinc and one molecule of molecular oxygen , [E2]you[/E2] produce two molecules of zinc oxide
two molecules of zinc and one molecule of molecular oxygen[/E2] oxygen , you produce two molecules of zinc oxide
into these two steps
You have zinc
You have oxygen
oxygen
this top reaction
O2 gaseous state plus two H2O liquid , plus four electrons
you 're going to have zinc
that we are reacting , we have the oxygen , we have the zinc , which are the two things ( mumbles ) interact here
all right , we have one molecule of molecular oxygen and we need two zincs
two zincs
with four hydroxides
well , if this reaction happened twice , you 'd would have just twice as many of the reactants and the products here
a molecule of molecular oxygen , two molecules of zinc
if you look at the total reaction , we 're neutral there , we have n't produced or lost any water
You have four electrons
You have [E2]four electrons
four electrons
why they did n't write it in this total reaction here
the total reaction , you 're using the molecular oxygen and the zinc
the reaction
well not only did we reverse it , we multiplied it by two
two of those reactions , would n't we multiply the voltage by two
twice or twice as much of the reaction , you 're gon na have twice as much of the energy
as potential energy per unit charge
the actual voltage
an important thing to think about
the energy released or taken
voltage , voltage is n't a quantity that depends on the number of charges or the number of molecules we 're doing to
voltage , voltage is n't [E2]a quantity that depends on the number of charges or the number of molecules we 're doing to
a quantity that depends on the number of charges or the number of molecules we 're doing to , [E2]it[/E2] 's a per
a quantity that depends on the number of charges or the number of molecules we 're doing to[/E2] to , it 's a per
what is the potential per unit charge
for this whole reaction
the combined voltage of both of these
hydroxide ions
The hydroxide
at the cathode
with this reaction
Mael
combinations of volumes of bleach and water for Mael 's sanitizing solution
lets
this is water in liters
3.75
75
it all
Let 's see , 15 goes into 37 two times , we have our little decimal right over here , two times 15 is 30 , subtract seven , bring down the five and then 15 times five is 75
to go from bleach to water we 're multiplying by a proportionality constant of 0.25
this next one
12 and three
0.75
0.25
by 0.25
the first three choices
our three answers
that 's not gon na work
Josh Sundquist
a YouTuber , best - selling author , and a paralympic ski racer
ski racing
through the course
I expected [E2]I[/E2] was gon na ski really well
in this race course
in those moments
that you have to look at the finish line
Jake and I
a loaf of bread
personal pronouns
pronouns that change depending on how you 're using them
to those
in later videos
an idea called grammatical person
Pronouns about me
first person
a first person pronoun
Here is a picture of Phryne
I think we can all agree
Some first person pronouns
I , me , my , and mine
Second
the singular and plural
In second person
Singular second person
you , your , and yours
plural second person
the same ,
you ,[/E2] , your ,[/E2] , and yours
Third person pronouns
to the most crowded category
For singular pronouns
she , her , and hers , he , him , and his , they , them , their and theirs and it , and its
like you
to both a single person or multiple people
note that the word it only refers to inanimate objects and sometimes non - human animals , but never to people
in the plural category
they , them , their , and theirs
Similar to singular versus plural
on context
a lot of information to swallow
the only time I 'll be talking about personal pronouns in this course
an opportunity to go deeper
a way that you can help us continue this work through your donations
that that core to NWEA 's work is really fighting for equity driving , impacting classrooms , and pushing for systemic change in our education communities
a big bunch of work to bite off
NWEA
by designing the professional learning that teachers need to stay on top of their craft
the work
into that
people who had established careers
that one of the things that NWEA does is research and understanding more about student learning
the kinds of questions you were investigating
our main focus
a lower performance
compared to the past trends
the largest declines in math
we think about , but you have a nice visual there
among students of color and students in high poverty schools
the positive bit that people did learn something over the pandemic , but did n't get as far as we would have liked them to get likely
parents
that question was coming up repeatedly
my child
young people get their thoughts out of their heads and let it come out and come through in the best way that
we can actually learn a lot from our young people in the sense that students always ask , why , " Why ? Why does this work ? Why do I do it that way
friends who are parents worry about what do they do if they do n't know the answer , if they do n't know how to do a math problem that their child brings to them
something that I understand about the content
about having the conversation sometimes instead of having to find the right answer right away
What should [E2]teachers[/E2] be thinking about
one ,
we should all come to an agreement that there was a lot of interrupted learning that took place
because of that interrupted learning
some unfinished learning
teachers are well - positioned right now to really assess what unfinished learning students might have
through the use of assessments
what students might be ready to learn , what they might have already mastered
informal ways to get data , to inform instruction right on the spot realtime
math language routines
on a math problem
by asking you to read the problem
Another thing we might do
entrance and exit tickets
you said three reads
" Okay , what is this problem about ?
are we trying to find out
You know what
you 're taking note
the intent is to really get behind what students are thinking
about the math
as the biggest challenges teachers face in teaching math
a huge challenge that was heightened during the pandemic
about how you might build structures to help students grow from where they are in the learning
even more variability throughout the class of where students are , we 've got even more levels that teachers are trying to address
some of the things they can do if they have students who are at seven different levels in what they 're trying to learn
in a classroom where you have students who their literacy level is pretty much non - existent , versus students who just needs to be challenged and sent to higher level math
if we start at that point , it feels too overwhelming
a daunting task
it 's important for our teachers to really get clear on what is it that my students
to assumptions
when we have assumptions like that , I have a colleague , Chase Nordengren , and he always says that assumptions are a threat to equity
in this case , assumptions could be a threat to
the biggest challenge
That was [E2]a challenge I faced throughout my entire career[/E2] career , is helping people understand , how do I keep my students engaged at levels that honor where they are , but still hold the standard or expectation for their grade level
a challenge I faced throughout my entire career
for the life of me
what seven times six is , that trips me up every single time
what seven times six is , that trips me[/E2] me up every single time
from then being able to learn about measurement in terms of area and volume
the job
for my teachers
how do I still teach this higher level concept while still throwing in opportunities for me to practice my facts
about , yes , if I teach seventh grade math , I have to be a master at that , but I also need to understand third , fourth , and fifth grade math , and sixth grade , and then eighth , ninth , and 10th grade math , because there are some concepts that you teach where you absolutely have to know the prerequisite skills
for a teacher
do teachers need to basically prepare lots of different lessons ?
about
just the preparation for teaching that area standard
that perspective of needing to design lessons that meet the needs of every single student in the sense that I 'm designing a lesson for each student group in my class
the approach we wanna take
them to support the instruction of this lesson
in layman 's terms
in building that story
a very long - winded way of saying we 're not designing lessons
one lesson
equitable opportunities for everyone to participate
in doing that
my goal of making sure that all students are getting access to that top rung and they 're moving up the ladder
my goal of making sure that[/E2] that all students are getting access to that[/E2] that top rung and they 're moving up the ladder
That makes sense
both of us
for organizations that believe that technology can potentially have a role in helping to address this particular problem of thinking about differentiation and making sure that students get the support they need and access to grade level material
a little bit about that MAP Accelerator experience and how it might fit into this
MAP Growth
a test that students take
what their level of readiness is
a test of mastery
at my zone
a wonderful , powerful tool that we have
teachers doing all the great things that
this tool that when students are working individually can help really target where they are based on those MAP Growth scores and help bring those together
like a good balance
technology fitting into classrooms
into certain routines
my Khan Academy time
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
the ritual
something like a Talk It Out Tuesday or a Work It Out Wednesday , or a Think About It Thursday
the technology
in the center
All right , it 's Talk It Out Tuesday
a little struggle
in the talking it out
a little bit more clarity
opportunity to then step outside of their head , do their thinking out loud , and continue working on their path
the peer - to - peer learning piece going on
them explaining to a caregiver which then puts them where it goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning about using math language with an adult maybe , and they can become the expert and explain how it 's done
both of those ideas where we 're not just having a student sitting in front of a computer isolated by themselves , but creating more of a community around the technology
about both the past year and how those students were fairing
sure that whatever digital tools that we 're using with our young people , we 're making it something so that it is a self - regulated tool for them
that 's one of the biggest tools that we need to employ
by the end of the school year , I want you to be able to do this
a weekly goal
sure that 's an achievable goal , it feels achievable , and it 's something that I can track my own progress on and I can talk about it and I can find reasons to celebrate
my language
how often ( laughing ) I talk about goals and goal setting
Nothing
success
like past success
a couple of questions
a young child
him flourish in his math studies
it 's really important for parents and caregivers to find ways to bring math alive in our students ' everyday life
I do n't even know how I use math in my everyday life
a book called " Math Curse
a lot of our school[/E2] school students
back in school
an eighth grader who does n't have to wear a uniform to school every day
at that age
about them
into a math problem
a second grader who 's totally fascinated by the cicadas
cicadas
cicada time
I heard
at nighttime
like a great note to end this on
that for me , at least , I had a great time playing with toy building blocks , and creating things out of them
blocks of different shapes and sizes
what does this have to do with cells
cells
Like my blocks
in a variety of shapes
all living things , or organisms
of these basic units called cells
that it 's actually made up of many smaller units
These units
Each cell
a flurry of activity
the smallest unit that can carry out all the tasks necessary for life
all cells
For instance
nutrients and water
These functions ,
what make life possible
all of these pictures of cells here
with the aid of microscopes
something else [E2]that I find really cool
that I find really cool[/E2] cool is that some organisms are made up of only a single cell , while others are made up of many cells
Uni
multi
that there is only one cell
an example of a unicellular organism
the e - coli bacteria that I mentioned a minute ago
Each bacterium
a single cell that 's responsible for taking in nutrients , reproducing , and doing all the things that it needs to stay alive
an example of a multicellular organism
you , me , or most any other organism[/E2] organism that you can see with the naked eye
some cells
the organism absorb nutrients
specialized cells
like different building blocks of different sizes , shapes , and colors
that cells are the smallest unit of life
about how all organisms are made up of cells , and that organisms can be unicellular or multicellular
that now you have a good understanding of cells and organisms , as well as a new perspective about building blocks , not the toys , but the cells that make up life itself
30 total play times
our indoor , indoor play times
our outdoor play times
our total play times
the original , original ratio
what information
the ratio of indoor to outdoor
two to three
about what would be the ratio of either of these to total play times
for every two indoor play times
that there was a 30 total actual play times
the actual number
to three
how many of the play times were indoors , 12 , and how many were outdoors , 18
about reproductive success
A plant that has more surviving offspring
a higher reproductive success
one major strategy that plants use to increase their chances of reproduction
by leveraging animals for pollination
pollination
a picture of a bee gathering nectar from this flower
in conditions where they are likely to succeed in living and then reproducing themselves
a dandelion plant
seed dispersal
the help of animals
a picture of a bird eating fruit from a plant
that bird flies away and munches on that fruit , that seed might be dispersed
In many cases
a fruit
a watermelon or a papaya and a couple of seeds go down while you ate it
you or some other animal
just an overview of some of the strategies that plants use
In a previous video
about how you can represent a system of equations as essentially a matrix equation
two equations with two unknowns x , y
our unknown variables , what we would want to solve for maybe
as this vector here
when we either think about it as a transformation on this unknown vector we get this known vector , we get the vector pq , or you can think about it as matrix multiplication
this vector
about this idea of inverses
to one color
for convenience
about this idea that if you have an inverse of a matrix
this matrix vector equation
what if we multiplied both sides on the left by the inverse of A
that 's just the matrix that if I try to transform anything or if I multiply anything by [E2]it[/E2] it 's just gon na give us that thing that we had before
that 's just the matrix that[/E2] that if I try to transform anything or if I multiply anything by it it 's just gon na give us that[/E2] that thing that[/E2] that we had before
on the right - hand side
a two by two matrix times the vector pq
the left - hand side[/E2] side , essentially the identity matrix times xy
on [E2]the left - hand side
this system
a clue about thinking when is it solvable
there 's two scenarios where we get either no solutions
that the lines have different slopes
one line
The situation which you have no solutions
if they are the same slope
Another weird situation [E2]that you get when you solve systems
that you get when you solve systems[/E2] systems is that they have the same slope , but they 're the same line
situations where we 're not finding a nice , clean , unique solution to our system
something like this ,
by is equal to p minus ax
ax
y is equal to p over b minus a over bx
in this first equation our slope is negative a over b
the slope here is negative c over d
these strange scenarios , not strange , but these scenarios where you do n't get a nice clean unique solution
the ones where these slopes are equivalent to each other
about the scenario in which negative a over b is equal to negative c over d
by a negative
the left - hand side[/E2] side , the b

a pretty neat clue about when you 're not going to see a nice neat solution to a systems of equations represented as a matrix vector equation like this
a situation where this is only going to be true , and I have n't proven it rigorously , but hopefully it gives you a little bit of a justification
a situation where A inverse does n't exist
about a matrix A
you 're taking things that have two dimensional area
the same result , not viewing matrix A as a transformation , but viewing it as a representation of a system of linear equations like this
the same idea that the determinant of A is equal to zero
I have some data here in the spreadsheet
Microsoft Excel
to shift the data up or down or if we were to multiply all the points by some value , what does [E2]that[/E2] do to the actual parameters
to shift the data up or down or if we were to multiply all the points by some value , [E2]what[/E2] does that do to the actual parameters
the median
the mean , [E2]the function[/E2] function on most spreadsheets
the mean , [E2]the function
the mean of that data
an easy way to do that in a spreadsheet
you select that , you add five , and then I can scroll down
my new dataset , or as I 'm calling Data+5
what the mean of that is
the mean of that
exactly five more
The mean
by the amount that I add or subtract
to my mean
these numbers
the median for that dataset
the medians gon na be if you take all of the data plus five
10.5

that this is my entire population
what happens when I shift everything by five
what I think
the standard deviation
this actually should , we should multiply by five here , and it does look like that is the case

in general , there 's an increase in the ionization energy
Beryllium 's
to 900 kilojoules per mole
Lithium
atomic number three
Beryllium
one more proton and one more electron
the nucleus , so a plus 4 charge , and [E2]for beryllium[/E2] beryllium , the electron configuration
the nucleus , so a plus 4 charge , and for beryllium , the electron configuration
for beryllium
one more proton in [E2]the nucleus , so a plus 4 charge , and for beryllium , the electron configuration[/E2] configuration is one s two
one more proton in the nucleus , so a plus 4 charge , and [E2]for beryllium[/E2] beryllium , the electron configuration is one s two
lithium
for lithium
a plus three charge
in the nucleus
that like charges repel
these two inner core electrons of lithium have a shielding effect
the outer electron
from the full positive three charge
it 's a similar situation
we have two inner electrons that are shielding this outer electron
we have two inner electrons that are shielding [E2]this outer electron
this outer electron
there are two
positive two
for a quick calculation
the outer electron for beryllium
an effective nuclear charge of positive two , which means that , it 's going to be pulled closer to the nucleus , there 's a greater attractive force on this outer electron for beryllium[/E2] beryllium , as compared to this outer electron for lithium
a greater attractive force
Boron
five electrons
that fifth electron
into a two p orbital
those two electrons in the two s orbital
this electron in the two p orbital
the reason for this slight decrease in ionization energy
an increase in ionization energy
to increased effective nuclear charge
Nitrogen
seven electrons to think about
it 's electron configuration
one s two , two s two , and two p three
care
of all seven electrons
For oxygen
another electron
our two s orbital
for nitrogen
for our two p orbitals
three electrons
We 're adding it to an orbital that already has an electron in it , so when I add that fourth electron to the two p orbital , it 's repelled by the electron that 's already there , which means it 's easier to remove one of those electrons
like charges

about DNA regulation
the general idea that if you look at a organism 's genome , that not all of the genes are being transcribed and translated at the same time
on the type of
type of immune cell
the DNA in both of these
the same inside
very different roles
So it does n't make sense , in fact
So it does n't make sense , [E2]in fact
in fact , in order for them to even have different structures
in fact[/E2] fact , in order for them to even have different structures
different enzyme proteins
inside of their cytoplasm
well if they have the exact same genome , how do they regulate which of those genes are being transcribed and then translated and which ones are n't
a bacterium
just one cell
the bacterial chromosome
a gene involved in the digestion of a certain type of food
This type of ,
into a little bit more detail about when you have several genes that are related and they tend to be transcribed all at once
some genes over here that are related to some type of stress mechanism
how DNA regulation works
about transcription in general , in several videos ago and in several videos , we talked about the idea of a promoter
a gene that is a sequence of DNA that 's part of the broader chromosome
that each promoter
so [E2]that[/E2] 's this part right over here
so that 's this part right over here
the promoter , so [E2]that[/E2] 's this part right over here , that 's the sequence
the promoter , [E2]so that 's this part right over here[/E2] here , that 's the sequence
a regulatory , regulatory DNA sequence
the RNA polymerase , which I drew as this big blob , it 's protein here , this big blob , will attach to
a combination of
that transcription process
that transcription process[/E2] process takes [E2]that genetic information in DNA
that transcription process takes that genetic information in DNA
this is just what I had just drawn
our big RNA polymerase blob
in an environment where we do n't want to transcribe this particular operon , this particular , or maybe I should say particular series of genes
about a repressor
And so this right over here , this is a protein that is called the repressor
And so this right over here , this is a protein that is called [E2]the repressor
the repressor , [E2]it[/E2] 's literally repressing the transcription , and the regulatory DNA sequence where it attaches , that is called the operator
the repressor[/E2] repressor , it 's literally repressing the transcription , and the regulatory DNA sequence where it attaches , that is called the operator
promoter
a regulatory sequence where the RNA polymerase can attach
the gene
from
extra mechanisms
its job
the other way around where we want even more transcription
the regulatory sequence where the activator binds
more activators , you 're gon na get more transcription
that this is repressing and this is activating
small molecules that [E2]you[/E2] could think of as activating the repressor , you can also have small molecules that can turn the activator on
inducers
this protein right here
that operon
just a high - level overview of DNA regulation
why the study , we can have the sequence , and in fact we do sequence entire genomes , but even once you have the sequence , it 's incredibly complex to understand all of these loops of these feedback and feedforward loops to understand how these things actually interact with each other .

In order for her to make that statement
the same conditions with the same lightning , the same air , the same material that the bacteria is growing on , everything the same , except for the treatment group , has the antibiotic

Then [E2]she[/E2] saw that in the treatment group that most of the bacteria died while in the control group , most of the bacteria did n't die
The most appropriate statistical study
a proper controlled experiment
a control group , where they do n't have the antibiotic
what are the choices here
is the study appropriate ?
that answer

On the the wellbeing and the instructional side
an enviable task
to a lot of district superintendents and administrators and teachers
pockets of people doing it well , either at the district level
a lot of the places , Like for example Newark
summer school
for places to do some summer schooling if they could
because of the kids who really needed it , who did n't connect well on on the screens , like you and I are having right now
in places like Detroit
the school
all the kind of protocols , including cleaning and everything and contact tracing to make sure that , that everybody who was in contact with the person who tested positive , they had gotten in contact with , and those people were isolating
the kind of thing that you have to do
an SOS
you got ta have a different structure
you 've got too much community spread in that community , and you need to be on remote instruction because school should not be open in that situation

with both summer school , as well as the starting of the school year , places that are doing it well and places that are doing it badly
a president who has been , who is breeding chaos instead of responsibility
the moment that you need to be really responsible , not chaotic
his recklessness
one example
In June
our members
South
Southwest
75 % of them
that if we could get the safety safeguards that we were advocating for , they were comfortable with going back to school buildings
how important it was and it is for kids , not just for feeding and not just for wellbeing , but for instruction as well
Newark
you see the reverse because they do n't have confidence that some of the precautions that you mentioned in the Newark place , like the Newark context , that those are in place , that 's where the fear is ? - [E2]I[/E2] would say you 'd see it for four reasons

that happened , [E2]I[/E2] would say that you 'd see a lot of places starting on remote
that unfortunately , because of the lack of resources and because of the COVID increase , you 're gon na see a lot of places starting on remote education
with the professional development , with tackling the virus
that this notion that they were gon na start with every single child , back on the day after labor day , and that would be , and they would gon na be able to do that , every school district that has attempted to do that initially is now rolling back their plans

that what you 're saying is , strikes where there are not precautions , where community spread is so high , that it would be just fundamentally unsafe
the word in front of strike
Safety , strikes and labor
a very particular meaning
only a last resort

what has happened in terms of the LGBTQ community , in terms of what happened in the aftermath of having the therapeutics , in the late 80s early 90s
I think we have to do in terms of instruction , [E2]this[/E2] is what I 've seen work
from talking to people who have done it over the course of the last several months
high school teachers
that they could actually tape a lesson
direct instruction like this
for younger kids
In terms of older kids
you flip it

In terms of the beginning of the year
as a bottom line , wellbeing and community building , and that the children will be okay , it 's gon na be most important
a calm mind
that means [E2]that[/E2] the wellbeing issues become really important and the engagement issues become very important as a pathway to getting to instruction
that last part
a much bigger problem
that , - No , [E2]I[/E2] think that some of this , I think that some of this , we 're gon na learn
I know [E2]I[/E2] 'm basically saying the rules have to be rewritten
we can actually figure out what [E2]we[/E2] need to do moving forward

are we gon na do with all our rules
We 're just
a lot of practices
we can say we know what 's best yet , because they have n't been tested

all the learning from people [E2]all throughout the last several months[/E2] months in terms of what has worked and what has n't
all the learning from people all throughout the last several months
all the learning from people [E2]all throughout the last several months
based on that , based on all of these data points you 've seen
Truth is very important
we need leadership [E2]that[/E2] will fight the pandemic
we need leadership that will fight the pandemic
frankly , even though the country is very polarized right now , more and more and more people see that , and that is really important
that out of this will be a sense that public schooling is really important
the means of parents who now have a healthy respect for that teaching is both a science and an art form and a craft as well as a skill , but that the whole alchemy of having public schools is important
that remote
that this gives a new kind of movement builder to science
it gives a sense that we have to work on things equitably
the people who have gotten really , really hurt
in this pandemic
just like so much else
in terms of who 's gotten the racial health disparities
how racism is really built into so many of our structures in America
that working families and working people , are the ones who have gotten us through where we 've gotten thus far
everyday people and governors in many states , who have really gotten us through this
kind of silver linings that I see
an incredible conversation
in this time to have any time with you
is a real honor
my apologies to Randi , I probably kept her longer than we originally promised , but I thought there was just too much to talk about
a couple of very powerful takeaways
You meet up in the park
reasonable options
on the instructional side
a lot of stress
it 's frankly an unrealistic goal
mini
tomorrow
about that versus which
myself to be right in - between these two camps which frequently makes me feel like I want to stick out my hands and say , " You guys stop fighting
it 's ruined more sentences than any other word in English through its overuse
half the people
that there are definite rules
From this entire argument
from these generations of just bickering
two distinctions
without commas
The carrot that was orange was tasty
the distinction here
that that just does n't play well with commas
distinction number one
the way I like to remember this
that I imagine a witch who does not like other people
a kind of a cranky witch who lives all alone in a house in the woods
The which witch
the way this shakes out
that which does n't refer to people , and that can refer to anything
with which
" The dog which I saw , the snow which fell , " the woman which boarded the plane
this to me , as a native speaker of English
who or that
because of some kind of rule of official grammar
the way that the language has shaken out
a connotation of human beings
the essential distinction
commas
in [E2]the last video
the last video , [E2]I[/E2] introduced the vector form of the multivariable chain rule
the last video[/E2] video , I introduced the vector form of the multivariable chain rule
the last video , I introduced the vector form of the multivariable chain rule
you have some kind of function f , and in this case I said it comes from a 100 dimensional space , so you might imagine--
a scalar valued function
you 're thinking , [E2]you[/E2] go from the single variable t to some very high dimensional space that we think of as full of vectors , and then you take from that over to a single variable , over to a number
the way you 'd write that out
you know , [E2]the way you 'd write that out[/E2] out is you 'd say f composed with the output of v , so f composed with v of t , and
you know , the way you 'd write that out is you 'd say f composed with the output of v , so f composed with v of t , and
what we 're interested in doing is taking its derivative
all [E2]that means
that means[/E2] means is that each component , you 're taking the derivative of it
the vectorized form of the multivariable chain rule
how much does that result in a change to the output of f , that 's answered by the directional derivative
this is why we use the nabla notation in the first place
an indicative of how we compute it
of whatever vector to your input point , that 's p
the nudge , the nudge away from that input point
w
the dot product between that and the vector itself , the vector that represents your nudge direction
a lot like the multivariable chain rule
this is very compact
quite a bit
a way that you could be thinking about this
v of t
V of t
you zooming all about
this derivative
And each one of these output points here represents the vector , v of t at some point , the derivative[/E2] derivative of that
And each one of these output points here represents the vector , v of t at some point , the derivative of that
kind of the whole meaning of this vector value derivative
by a little bit
" Okay , so I 've moved a little bit " in this intermediary 100 dimensional space , " how does that influence the output of f " based on the behavior of just " the multivariable function f ?
It says
you take a nudge in the direction of some vector
you take a nudge [E2]in the direction of some vector
in the direction of some vector , in this case
in the direction of some vector[/E2] vector , in this case
v prime of t
any vector w , you take a nudge in that direction
that change to be larger
the directional derivative
this is a very beautiful way of understanding the multivariable chain rule
this image of , you know , you 're thinking of v of t , and you 're thinking of zipping along in some way , and the direction and value of your velocity as you zip along is what determines the change in the output of the function f
one of those nice little interpretations
that would be 63
that is 42 more spots than the total number of spots on a six sided die
if you took a six sided die , so a six sided die , might look something like this
a cube
63
The first thing you should always ask yourselves
they 're asking for
Another way of thinking about it
if you took the number of spots on a six sided die that 's what they 're asking for
63 or 63 spots
42 is [E2]63 or 63 spots[/E2] spots is 42 more spots[/E2] spots than the total number of spots[/E2] spots on a six sided die
the same thing as saying that question mark is equal to 63 , 63 minus 42

We 'll go to ones[/E2] ones place
We 'll go to ones place

the first three non - zero terms of the Maclaurin series for the function f of x
So , our f of x can be approximated by the polynomial
we 're gon na evaluate f at zero
that 's why [E2]it[/E2] 's a Maclaurin series
that 's why it 's a Maclaurin series
that 's why [E2]it 's a Maclaurin series
that 's why it 's [E2]a Maclaurin series
it 's a Maclaurin series , [E2]it[/E2] 's gon na be centered at zero
it 's a Maclaurin series , it 's gon na be centered at zero
it 's a Maclaurin series[/E2] series , it 's gon na be centered at zero
it 's [E2]a Maclaurin series , it 's gon na be centered at zero
a Maclaurin series , it 's gon na be centered at zero
a Maclaurin series[/E2] series , it 's gon na be centered at zero
we wanna do , [E2]we[/E2] could find the Maclaurin
we wanna do , we could find [E2]the Maclaurin
the Maclaurin , we can find the first three non - zero terms of the Maclaurin series for cosine of x
the Maclaurin[/E2] Maclaurin , we can find the first three non - zero terms of the Maclaurin[/E2] Maclaurin series for cosine of x
the the second derivative , well , derivative of sine
cosine
the second derivative evaluated at zero is going to be equal to negative one
I take [E2]the derivative[/E2] derivative of this , when I take the fourth derivative[/E2] derivative , I get back to cosine of x
I take [E2]the derivative of this , when I take the fourth derivative , I get back to cosine of x
the derivative[/E2] derivative of this , when I take [E2]the fourth derivative[/E2] derivative , I get back to cosine of x , the fourth derivative[/E2] derivative is the same thing as the function
the derivative of this , when I take the fourth derivative , I get back to cosine of x[/E2] x , the fourth derivative is the same thing as the function
the first three non - zero terms
And then , the next one is going to be our second derivative , so it 's minus one over two factorial times x squared
And then , [E2]the next one is going to be our second derivative , so it 's minus one over two factorial times x squared
the next one is going to be our second derivative , so it 's minus one over two factorial times x squared
it involves the fourth derivative , [E2]it[/E2] 's gon na be divided by four factorial
both sides of this times
x minus one over two factorial , times x to the third power
some people
it somewhat committed to memory , what the Maclaurin series expansion of cosine of x and sine of x are , and sometimes e to the x , as well
a very fast process where you just multiply that by x

Angle A

just a fancy way of saying does the function have a defined derivative at a point
For the sake of [E2]this[/E2] video , I 'll write it as the derivative of our function at point C
For the sake of this video , I 'll write it as the derivative of our function at point C
Lagrange notation with this F prime
the first claim that I 'm going to make
if F is differentiable , at X equals C
if F is differentiable [E2], at X equals C
, at X equals C
if we know it 's differentiable , if we can find this limit , if we can find this derivative at X equals C
the other way around
another way to interpret what I just wrote down
if you are not continuous , then you definitely will not be differentiable
differentiable , differentiable[/E2] differentiable at X
then F is not differentiable
Our function is defined at C
C comma F of C
in all of those cases
the slope of this line
this expression
that our slope is actually approaching negative infinity
a very different value from the right
This expression
a very different value from the right as it is from the left
this case[/E2] case , this limit up here
in [E2]this case
this is not differentiable
an intuition for if something is n't continuous , it 's pretty clear , at least in this case , that it 's not going to be differentiable
This is X
the point X
a situation where this expression right over here is going to approach negative infinity
And if we approach from the right , if we approach with Xs larger than C , well , this is our X comma F of X , so we have a positive slope and
a finite value
one side
positive infinity
a rigorous proof
well , what about the situations where F is not even defined at C
good arguments for when you 're not continuous , you 're not going to be differentiable
an absolute value function
if X
at this slope which is actually going to be the same
a negative one
The slope of the line that connects these points
So the limit of this expression ,
two different values
From the left , it 's approaching negative one
from the right
if you 're approaching two different values from on the left side or the right side of the limit , then this limit will not exist
of the derivative
as the slope of the tangent line
an infinite number of tangent lines
well , maybe this is the tangent line right over there , but then why ca n't I make something like this the tangent line ?
the tangent line
These two examples
some intuition for that
that if something is continuous that it has to be differentiable
the graph of the function f of x " is equal to x - squared

Constitution
In this series of videos about the Constitution
all the elements of balance and compromise that appear in the Constitution , the balance between large states and small states and between the different branches of government
all the elements of balance and compromise that appear in the Constitution[/E2] Constitution , the balance between large states and small states and between the different branches of government
these compromises reveal some real conflict among the framers over how they think the American Revolution did
in things like the Senate
The founders
all white men to be able to vote
voting to be reserved to the elite , the propertied , the educated , those who were prepared to be virtuous citizens
until the 1820s
that all white men could vote in elections , regardless of how much property they owned
until the late 19th and 20th centuries
that women and minorities would get the right to vote
a very dim idea of the average citizen 's ability to engage productively in democracy
another way that they show this [E2]in the Constitution
in the Constitution[/E2] Constitution is in the process of electing the president
Article II
the executive branch
it 's [E2]a kinda complex process[/E2] process , the electoral college
a kinda complex process
the simple version
that instead of having citizens vote directly for the president , the citizens would vote in each state , and then that state would have electors equal to the number of senators and representatives
those electors
votes for the president
a map of the current number of electoral votes that each state has
into a slightly more complicated indirect system
you have a solid that you know is mostly sodium chloride , you suspect that it might have or it may have some sodium iodide , potassium chloride or lithium chloride as well
that it contains 73 % chlorine by mass
the sample
pure sodium chloride
the way [E2]we 're going to approach it
we 're going to approach it[/E2] it is we 're gon na think about each of these compounds and try to figure out the percent chlorine by mass
22.99
35.45
126.90
39.10
6.94
the sodium 's average atomic mass
my period table of elements
that will be the most useful thing to do
the various compounds
the percent Cl
by mass
about sodium chloride
chlorine 's molar mass
35.45 grams per mole
it equal
that to the first question , is the sample pure sodium chloride
pure sodium chloride would look like
with something that has a higher percentage of chlorine by mass
at sodium iodide
the average
the percent chlorine
this character
its percent chlorine
the molar mass of chlorine[/E2] chlorine , 35.45 divided by the molar mass of the entire compound
the molar mass of potassium , 39.10
the same numerator
we 're going to get a lower value than 61 %
less than 61 %
its percent chlorine by mass
to the molar mass of lithium which is actually quite low ,
a smaller denominator , which means that the whole value is going to be larger
approximately 84 % chlorine by mass

This passage
from Kasley Killam ,
A Hug A Day Keeps the Doctor Away , okay
A Hug A Day Keeps the Doctor Away ,[/E2] , okay
during my final semester of undergrad
two signs that read , feeling stressed about exams , have a free hug
Passersby
one of two reactions , either they quickly looked down at their phones and awkwardly shuffled by , or their faces lit up as they embraced us
You made my day
, " You made my day ! " Or " thank you , I needed this
, " [E2]You made my day[/E2] day ! " Or " thank you , I needed this
my friend and I
After two hours of warm interactions
how energized and happy we felt
A study published earlier this month
that , in addition to making us feel connected to others , all those hugs may have prevented us from getting sick
this finding
that hugging hundreds of strangers , hugging strangers would increase your exposure to germs and therefore the likelihood of falling ill , okay
a but here
this research
to a large amount of evidence for the positive influence of social support on health
a topic sentence that said feeling connected to others seems to have these health benefits and hugging a lot of people , rather than exposing you to germs , actually , according to the Carnegie Mellon study offers some protection against stress - induced sickness , okay
I think [E2]I[/E2] understand that
the Rephrase & Predict strategy that we mentioned
the purpose of the first paragraph
the author 's story about something he did in undergrad , about making signs and mentioned how positive this hugging experience was and then , in the next paragraph , we 've got the study and the impact of hugs and we get a little more scientific here and so the first paragraph serves mainly to , or the purpose of the first paragraph , my prediction

So , when I was reading this passage earlier , this seemed like [E2]the author 's story about something he did in undergrad , about making signs and mentioned how positive this hugging experience was and then , in the next paragraph , we 've got the study and the impact of hugs and we get a little more scientific here and so the first paragraph serves mainly to , or the purpose of the first paragraph , my prediction[/E2] prediction here is going to be that it was a story and then if we look at the structure here , we have the story here and then we have the study here , so that 's kind of how I 'm thinking about it , story that leads into the study and so that 's my prediction[/E2] prediction and , as you can see , it does n't have to be super sophisticated and complex

about complex sentences
in another video
about simple and compound sentences
with a complex sentence
something called a dependent clause
a sentence
at least one independent clause
with complex
this dependent clause
the second one ,
on its own
as a sentence
we have to make sure it 's lemon
as an independent clause , as its own sentence
some information that might be missing from this sentence
a subject ,
the sentence
on some information that 's not provided
we can have a sentence before it
two separate sentences
In [E2]this case
this case [E2]we[/E2] have this other clause
this case[/E2] case we have this other clause
when we buy his birthday cake as a sentence , that does n't really stand on its own , it does n't convey
an independent clause or a sentence that 's just we buy his birthday cake
kind of a weird construction
his birthday cake still works as a sentence
It has a subject we and a verb buy , and [E2]it[/E2] expresses a complete idea
It has a subject we and a verb buy , and it expresses a complete idea
an action that 's happening
But we add this thing called a subordinating conjunction , that 's this word when , here , and that makes this into a dependent clause
But we add this thing called [E2]a subordinating conjunction , that 's this word when , here , and that makes this into a dependent clause

another example of a complex sentence
the sound of hyenas in the distance
this sentence
with a dependent clause
sort of just something that you need to remember
two sentences where the dependent clause is coming before the independent clause , but
that would still be a complex sentence
an independent clause
because it 's his favorite is a dependent clause
, right ?
as a complex sentence
as many dependent clauses as you want ?
that 's complex sentences
an independent clause that can be a sentence

a function with a multi - variable input
as a two - dimensional space as the input or just two separate numbers
The y component
s times t
that z component
t times s - squared
like partial of v
with respect to one of its input variables
its derivative
But s - squared looks like a constant ,
S times t ,
a constant and when t looks like a variable ,[/E2] , has a derivative of s
t times s - squared[/E2] squared , when t 's the variable and s is the constant
like that constant[/E2] constant , which is s - squared
a derivative of t - squared

1.585
This first table
that for any given value of X , what is the value of b to the x
that b to the 1.585 is equal to 3
2.322
that b to the 2.322 is 5
2.807
b to the 2.807
2.169
b to the 2.169
this table over here
for any given value of y
Log base b of 2

so this is literally
that log base b of 10d is equal to 2.322
what this last column tells us
what a , b , c , and d are
just a bunch of numbers
b to the 1.585 power is 3
this table
This first column right over here
that log base b of a , so now y is equal to a , that that is equal to 0
an equivalent statement to

what this column is telling us
our y
2c
as b ,
if we write in exponential form , b to the 1.585 is equal to 2c
if we write in exponential form ,[/E2] , b to the 1.585 is equal to 2c
b to the 1.585

a very similar idea to what we used to find the sum of a finite geometric series
it 's going all the way to infinity
all the way to infinity
you get the general idea
just like
well what happens if you take the sum and if you were to multiply every term by your common ratio
And the reason why I said this is
And the reason why I said [E2]this is
this is " proofy " is this is not always clear--
this is[/E2] is " proofy " is[/E2] is this is[/E2] is not always clear--
when you 're multiplying something times infinite terms or an infinite sum , at least this will be at least give you the general idea
about and infinity , sometimes [E2]I[/E2] just think about things
this infinite sum

you see where this is going

by 3/5
what the sum is going to be
It 's going to be our first term--
our common ratio
a sum of infinite terms
here it even works out mathematically in this denominator that you are going to get a reasonable answer
with a geometric series
with a
this formula that[/E2] that we just derived
for that
a plus a plus a plus a , going on and on forever

that last
OK , let 's see , 1,296 divided by 625 is this value
1.2 times 1.2 gets us--
close enough
by brute force
1.2 to the fourth power
this value
one way , kind of a brute - force way , of figuring out that t is equal to 4
125
that 5 to the first is 5 , 5 squared is 25 , 5 to the third is 125 , 5 to the fourth is 625
this right over here is 5 to the fourth
6/5
the same thing as 6/5 to the fourth power
well , 6/5 to the t needs to be equal to 6/5 to the fourth power

the graph of a two - variable function
the function that you 're looking at
f of x , y
if I take the partial derivative of this function , so maybe I 'm looking at the partial derivative of f with respect to x , and let 's say I want to do this at negative one , one so I 'll be looking at the partial derivative at a specific point
on this whole graph
this is our x - axis
this is our x - axis , this is our y - axis the point negative one
this is our x - axis[/E2] axis , [E2]this is our y - axis[/E2] axis the point negative one
the first thing [E2]you might do
you might do[/E2] do is you say well , when we 're taking the partial derivative with respect to x , we 're going to pretend that
sine of y
x squared looks like a variable
x squared looks [E2]like a variable
y looks like a constant
like a variable , y[/E2] y looks like a constant
like a variable[/E2] variable , y looks like a constant
like a variable , [E2]y looks like a constant
two times negative one multiplied by one , which is two
for the graph
the y - axis , and the plane that cuts it perpendicularly that represents a constant y value

at that value
this here is the x - axis[/E2] axis ; this plane
this here is [E2]the x - axis ; this plane
So [E2]this here is the x - axis
So this here is [E2]the x - axis
the x - axis ; this plane[/E2] plane represents the constant value x equals negative one
the x - axis[/E2] axis ; this plane represents the constant value x equals negative one
the red line again that represents the curve
all the points on the graph where x equals negative one
x squared to be a constant now
cosine y
And [E2]I[/E2] 'm not sure what the cosine of one is but it 's something
And I 'm not sure [E2]what the cosine of one is[/E2] is but it 's something
what the cosine of one is
about people talking about the partial derivative as being the slope of the slice of a graph
in other contexts
something that has a multidimensional output
at your point here
that makes some kind of change , it causes a change in the function which you 'll call partial f
just one way of interpreting that ratio , the change in the output that corresponds to a little nudge in the input
about different ways that

in terms of the amount of radioactivity it produces
this the amount of caesium-137 that causes A becquerels of radioactivity
as a quantity
the quantity that causes A becquerels of activity
that the amount at times 0 - - well , that 's going to be equal to c

something that 's very hard to compute in your head
you use a calculator for that
So we get 0.9771599
how many becquerels of caesium-137 remain in our sample 150 days after its release in the soil ?
c and r
0.977
that the amount of caesium-137 in becquerels-- as a function of time in days-- is going to be equal to 8 times 0.977 to the t power--
where t is the number of days that have passed
a calculator
150th

The apostrophe
just a punctuation mark
the word apostrophe
from Greek , from two different compounds
a turning away
in rhetoric
it 's
turning away from your actual audience to deliver a message to absent people or inanimate objects or just non - personified
a punctuation mark , it was a literary technique
the stylus
into my breast
thy sheath
in that
the dagger
a knife
the moon
from [E2]this[/E2] figure of speech
how we come to get its main use , to represent that something , that it 's standing in for absent letters , just like an apostrophe in rhetoric would be delivered to absent friends
a guess
instead of like , " aime " meaning " loved
instead of [E2]like , " aime " meaning " loved
like , " aime " meaning " loved , " [E2]it[/E2] would be " aime " like that
like , " aime " meaning " loved[/E2] loved , " it would be " aime " like that
the person that used it originally in French to start representing eliminated letters
this apostrophe in there
centuries
around this time
that this apostrophe starts making its way into English
about the Norman Conquest of 1066
everyone in a position of power
This is [E2]around the time when you first see the contraction of " I am , " " I 'm , " show up
around the time when you first see the contraction of " I am , " " I 'm , " show up[/E2] up , is around this period
with how apostrophes are used in other languages too
in Latin
these long definite articles like " ille , " i l l e , or " illa , " i l l a
Romance
all the definite articles that come out of this in all the Romance languages
some fraction of the original
from Latin
just l apostrophe
for contractions
for multiples of stuff , like stuff that we would consider incorrect today
for the possessive
for now
the history of the introduction of the apostrophe into English
the entire solution set for the following equation
that all the x 's that can satisfy this equation are a combination of these x 's and these x 's here
The reason why I 'm referring to each of them as numerous xs
that for any integer value of n , you 'll get another solution
For any integer value of n
another solution
the way that we 're going to do it
by exploring all of the x values that satisfy this equation that sit in the closed interval from negative pi over two to zero
like always
the first helpful thing
we have these algebraic expressions
things written in terms of pi
1.57
negative pi over two
1/8
0.22
So this could be rewritten as x is approximately
I encourage you to verify this on your own on a calculator
that that 's approximately 0.22
that that 's approximately[/E2] approximately 0.22
approximately 0.22 minus 0.785 times n , where n could be any integer
And then [E2]this[/E2] one over here on the right , let me do that in this yellow , x could be approximately equal to , well
And then this one over here on the right , let me do that in this yellow , x could be approximately equal to , well
just the negative of it
what approximately pi over four is , so 0.785n
at n equals zero
The upper bound of that interval
in the interval
lower values
0.785
that here
a solution in that interval right over here
-1.35
-2.14
all of a sudden
out of the interval
a situation where n equals one
to this
0.57
you immediately know that that 's going to be a positive value
0.57 , which is larger than zero
we 're subtracting 0.785 from this right over here which would get us to -1.01
to -1.79 , which is lower than -1.57
all of the x values that are in our interval that satisfy this equation

Obligations
actions that citizens are required to fulfill
some of these obligations
The Constitution
the right to a trial by a jury of their peers
citizens
What other obligations
Most states
the exact ages and requirements
from state
in the naturalization oath that new citizens must take
only men or people assigned male at birth
at this time
for selective service between the ages of 18 and 26

in U.S
Her research interests
jury provisions in The Bill of Rights , civil procedure , and employment law
Thomas
a little bit about why the Framers were so interested in protecting this right in particular
that the jury restrained government and preserved liberty
British
One of the reasons
that juries had been important in helping to nullify British laws that the American colonists did n't like
An example of these laws
the customs taxes
taxes on shipping
Boston
the customs collector
The customs inspector
an action , a lawsuit , against the ship and the cargo
in a court called the Court of Admiralty , which was a type of court that sat without a jury
The judge in [E2]the Court of Admiralty
the Court of Admiralty[/E2] Admiralty would ordinarily require the merchant
an action for trespass against the customs inspector
that juries could be really useful
a civil trial
Just for our general information
a civil case
people who are trying to prove the case
In that type of case
someone
in the criminal context
on the other hand
of doing a crime
For criminal cases
beyond a reasonable doubt
versus in a civil case by a preponderance of the evidence
a higher standard
in the O.J
throughout the fourth through eight amendments , which deal with the protection of the accused , quite an emphasis on juries
members of the colonial legislatures
a way that without an elected legislature the colonists could get representation
that juries were like popularly elected legislatures
that function
in the American colonies
that the Framers believed that the jury was actually perfect , but they thought that the jury was the best decision maker
The difficulty
that very , very few cases go to juries
one of the astounding things that many people do n't know about
Parties
a motion to dismiss the case
Judges
in this time frame
in this time[/E2] time frame
around the 1930 period of time
A New York State judge
Yes , a judge[/E2] judge should be preferred to a jury
Yes , a judge should be preferred to a jury
just a couple of different ideas that I think are contributors to why juries decide few cases today
Interesting
by this diversity
diversity do [E2]you[/E2] mean like diversity of people from different classes or different genders or different races
diversity do you mean like diversity of people from different classes or different genders or different races
diversity do you mean like diversity[/E2] diversity of people from different classes or different genders or different races
about sex and race
another example that is [E2]something that I 've spent a good amount of time in my career talking about
something that I 've spent a good amount of time in my career talking about[/E2] about is something called summary judgment
Summary judgment
a procedure where a judge can decide what a reasonable jury could find
a case for employment discrimination
summary judgment
judges
in certain cases
One of the reasons it 's so much more expensive
that we now have a system of what we call discovery
the parties
for information from each other
before the trial
The reason it 's so important for the parties to save money
that in our system each side in a dispute ,
expenses
settlement
For all these reasons
about the sign convention for passive components
a big mouthful
Passive
the way we describe components that do not create power or components that do not amplify signals
all three of those
passive components
something like a battery or a voltage source is a passive component because it ca n't amplify a signal
with the way to label this resistor with its current and voltage
to Ohm 's law , our friend , voltage equals current , which is i times r
the question[/E2] question is , [E2]the question[/E2] question we want to answer is which direction does the current go
into the end
with the positive sign on the voltage
another one of these , same sort of thing
the voltage
The question
which way does the current go
the sign convention for passive components
into the voltage
that would still mean the same thing
in the positive
We 'll draw a curly inductor , like that
We 'll draw [E2]a curly inductor , like that
a curly inductor , like that , [E2]we[/E2] 'll put a voltage
a curly inductor , like that[/E2] that , we 'll put a voltage
a curly inductor , like that , we 'll put a voltage
I 'll put the voltage on [E2]this[/E2] side , plus , minus v
I 'll put the voltage on this side , plus , minus v
our inductor
in the same side as the plus
on the minus side
with a resistor
the passive component sign convention , how do [E2]we[/E2] label the voltage
the idea of a sign convention for passive components
the way you do it
So right here ,
for a
one side of an equation
to the fifth power
the same thing as 3 to the a
the exponent property here
if you raise a base to some exponent and then raise that whole thing to another exponent , that 's the equivalent of raising the base to an exponent that is the product of these two exponents
this left - hand side
that 5 times a needs to be equal to 2
by 5
a is equal to 2/5
an interesting result
the motivation for how we define rational exponents
that 3 to the 2/5 power--
the denominator here , [E2]that[/E2] 's the root
the same thing as 3 squared
to the 1/5 power
that property
at play
these two exponents
3 to the 2/5 power
freedom
definitions of freedom , citizenship , and democracy
In reality
before and after Reconstruction
African Americans
Before the end of slavery
neither economic nor physical freedom
control of their bodies or of their labor
The pass system
from moving freely
their physical and economic freedom
how much
Most African Americans
that their years of unpaid toil entitled them to land of their own
most black farmers
sharecroppers
a lot more freedom over their own work
sharecropping

you could view this as being equal to ,[/E2] , eight is the same thing as eight over one or eight wholes

with 56 tenths
we would expect this product
the product to be a little bit less than eight

well , that 's a lot less than eight
another way that [E2]you could approach this

a pretty involved process
kind of the traditional narrative
a six - carbon - chain
the process of glycosis , which is occurring in the cytosol , the cytosol of our cells

the next thing [E2]that 's going to happen
that 's going to happen[/E2] happen , is that the carboxyl group , and and everything I 'm going to show now , it 's going to happen[/E2] happen for each of these pyruvates
these things all happening twice
our carbon dioxide being released here , and then the rest of our pyruvate , which is , essentially , an acetyl group , that latches onto coenzyme A
a lot about coenzyme A
just CoA , like this
CoA , and then the sulfur , bonded to the hyrdrogen
the carbon dioxide being released , and then the acetyl group , bonding with that sulfur
three letters
This is actually a picture of acetyl - CoA
it 's really small
That , the acetyl group that we 're talking about
just this part , right over here
an adenine
as a coenzyme

on to the coenzyme A
sure that I do n't lose track of my accounting
for one glucose molecule
for one glucose molecule , [E2]it[/E2] 's gon na happen for each of the pyruvates

the important take - away
as we go through the citric acid cycle , as we go from one intermediary to the next , we keep reducing NAD to NADH
, is as we go through the citric acid cycle , as we go from one intermediary to the next , we keep reducing NAD to NADH , in fact , we do this three times for each cycle of the citric acid cycle , but remember , we 're gon na do this for each acetyl - CoA
, is [E2]as we go through the citric acid cycle , as we go from one intermediary to the next , we keep reducing NAD to NADH[/E2] NADH , in fact , we do this three times for each cycle of the citric acid cycle , but remember , we 're gon na do this for each acetyl - CoA
one , two , three NADH 's being produced
in the process
carbon molecule to four - carbon molecule ,
as you 're breaking down , going from the six - carbon molecule to four - carbon molecule , you 're releasing carbon , as carbon dioxide
as you 're breaking down ,[/E2] , going from the six - [E2]carbon molecule to four - carbon molecule ,[/E2] , you 're releasing carbon ,[/E2] , as carbon dioxide

that Lauren uses a blend of dark roast beans and light roast beans to make coffee at her cafe
80 kilograms of beans in total
for her next order

Dark roast beans
$ 3 per kilogram

here 's a graph that shows a system of equations for this scenario where x is the number of kilograms of dark roast beans she buys
what they told us up here
She needs
in blue
80 kilograms of beans
this blue line
the dark roast beans
Two y
how much she spends on light roast 'cause it 's $ 2 per kilogram
the amount that she spends in total
another way of expressing what I just underlined up here in green
the green line
all of the x y combinations that would match these constraints
some points here , point C , D , F , and E
about what do each of these points represent
that means [E2]that[/E2] the amount that she spends on dark roast plus the amount that she spends on light roast is adding up to exactly $ 220
above that line
Three times 20 plus two times 60
a point where we 're meeting this constraint
less than 220
a situation where she is spending exactly $ 220 , and the total number of kilograms she 's using of dark and light is exactly 80

in both of them , we see the extracellular matrix
on this animal or outside of this animal cell , you see all these collagen fibers and everything else , all these fibers that are holding these cells into place and allow these cells to relate to each other , and actually , depending on what 's inside of it , can even help signal different things to the cells , so this is an extracellular matrix

murmurs
one of the things I thought would be really interesting to talk about
how ( murmurs )
one of the things that was the most important to me was this underlying assumption that all students could achieve at a very high level
The motivation for our students is really internal
pressure from parents
the year round model for us is really exciting
the school day
at five or 6 pm
breaks
No they do n't really like it when they 're sick
the opposite of probably what some other schools have to deal with when kids are malingering
there 's a couple like
pre
some of those beliefs
What has been , you know you kinda takeaway
do you think y' all have done that have worked out well , and what are other learnings ?
time
on passionate projects
on things like executive skills , in addition to social emotional learning , but really those skills that are so important when people leave school , but that most schools do n't talk about or help support students in developing
a brick and mortar school
school
from the building
to home
A lot of our students , even the younger ones again
that muscle of planning out their work , handing things in using an electronic forum
that 's been really beneficial for our students
also for our older students particularly our seniors , we have our first graduating class coming up
a mastery based system , which means that students can move forward once they 've mastered material
sort of a 90 %
sort [E2]of a 90 %
of a 90 % , of mastery of all the material
of a 90 %[/E2] % , of mastery of all the material
the space to really achieve and do well
a lot of ways it 's not a technology focused school
about student agency and collaboration and human interaction
the existence of tools like Khan Academy
the existence of tools like[/E2] like Khan Academy
us to re
imagine what the actual school day or school structure could look like
Rachel
to a large degree
is gon na happen broadly , to just someone who observes the education space
about where our students are developmentally where a K to 12
what we 've discovered , even though everyone is in their own home or apartment learning is that it 's the community piece that 's really helped
about , where our students are in terms of what they 're able to do on their own
about the social aspects
because
that social aspect
we 're looking at sort of a hybrid model of having students at home , having students come to campus when possible
KLS
you know it 's
the word Academy actually comes from a field where Plato used to teach or have Socratic dialogues outside , and then it became his Akadēmos
a big fan
it builds character
we 're meant to be in nature
one question that I think a lot of folks are struggling with especially parents of young kids are , how do we talk about what 's going on in the world
for us
in terms of sort of building up our kids self worth
about making sure they have as many mirrors as possible in their day to day lives , including schools
what books are in the school library and what does the student population look like
Stamped
a great book that I would recommend
The New Jim Crow
a young readers edition and also a teacher 's guide
Black
one it 's important whether you 're a parent or a teacher , when you 're having conversations the point is n't to necessarily re - traumatize particularly your Black and Brown students
a picture of him
there 's a lot about American history that people in the U.S
some of the most multicultural
just the people who are in the street protesting police brutality
on Anti - racism
the most diverse group of people that this country has ever seen
Like why should anyone be you know , based on their skin
with their head
the reality is that even though , they 're young kids and young kids have a very well developed sense of justice
that we do n't question
how we interact with people
these conversations
that you ca n't assume that kids do n't see color
is , is the difference a bad thing
there 's also the conversation about even sort of the most innocuous things that people
that conversation
something you have to be conscious about
into to bad habits
Marshmello
Marshmello from YouTube
how will COVID evolutionize learning
the new normal
what implications do [E2]you[/E2] think it might have broadly , you know well beyond KLS in the system as a whole
it shines a light on how incredibly creative teachers can be in a moment
for a lot of support
all of this shines a light on the fact that the teaching actually should follow the student where they are
And so giving less weight to just how long has a student sat in a class , but more
And so giving less weight to just how long has a student sat [E2]in a class[/E2] class , but more
in a class
the point
the underlying belief that all students can achieve at a really high level is somewhat radical
I think [E2]I[/E2] 'm really having belief in all kids and allowing more space and time
there are probably millions of parents across this nation who have a deeper appreciation for teachers and what they do , because it 's hard
a lot of hoop jumping
my own take
exactly what you 're saying is I think there 's a world where post - COVID the whole system you know , this hybrid environment we 're in it is actually , it 's making a lot of educators , a lot of systems have to think a little bit more in the direction that y' all have already been thinking at KLS which is , how do we give students more agency but at the same time give them constraints and accountability , so that they are able to add supports , with teachers but you know , rethinking
lecture
the best thing
an incredible job
we can do this again in the near future
you know I get a an undue amount of credit for both Khan Academy and for Khan lab school , because of , I guess there 's a name association
( Khan laughs ) -
one of the people in my life , who 's really you know , doing the real on the groundwork of driving this broader vision and this broader mission forward
a pleasure
about synchronous versus asynchronous learning
it 's a great time for education
as a country , we 're poised to have some fundamental change for the better of all of us
a nice conclusion going
initially , when everyone had to shelter in place the instinct was to sort of take what you were doing in the building , and then just map it to an online platform
Even for the teachers , the students
the conversation
what is great for students to be able to do together ?
from kindergarten all the way through 12th grade
part of it is that in those moments they 're being asked to interact
in math classes
you need both
they 're learning less

can you have a combination of both ?
And you indeed can

when things converge you 're kind of
we have the function F of X is equal to X to the sixth , minus three X to the fifth
that a function is decreasing when its derivative is negative

one situation
three X to the fourth

any situation for any X where three X to the fourth is less than zero
our best hope
three X to the fourth , greater than zero

you have a negative value there , if you have a negative one , you take it to
you have [E2]a negative value there , if you have a negative one[/E2] one , you take it to
a negative value there , if you have a negative one
the entire interval where our function is decreasing
over the interval
from negative infinity
all the way up to zero
to five halves
for decreasing right to the left of zero
there 's something interesting here
And so the interval that we care about the interval over which we 're decreasing is just
less than five halves
Desmos
that by graphing the function , I graphed it on Desmos , and you can see here that the function is decreasing from negative infinity , it 's decreasing at a slower and slower rate we get to zero

the embarrassment factor of having to ask someone else
local linearity
this idea that if we zoom in sufficiently on a point , that even a non - linear
on a point
for example ,
the derivative at the point one
this idea of local linearity
For any other x value
this local linearity idea
rigorous mathematics
this sharp corner
an actual infinite number of lines that go through one comma zero but that do not go through the rest of the curve
a hard corner like we 're seeing at one comma zero in this absolute value function , [E2]that[/E2] 's a pretty good indication that we are not going to be differentiable at that point
a good example of that
square root of let 's say four minus x squared
the top half of a circle of radius two
even more like a corner there
at this scale
this curve
to the point one comma zero
like a line
this local linearity that 's a non - vertical line
at any point on this curve
sometimes you might have to zoom in a lot , a tool like Desmos which I 'm using right now is very helpful for doing that
of if you zoom in and it looks like the tangent might be vertical , well then some questions
in and it still looks like a hard corner , [E2]of if you zoom in and it looks like the tangent might be vertical , well then some questions[/E2] questions should arise in your brain
Newton 's Law of Cooling
a negative K
We assumed our concept K[/E2] K is positive
a negative
a negative rate of chance
Temperature
in a previous video on Newton 's Law of Cooling
a general solution to that
Given that
our general solution
In that situation
to temperature
in our last video
we were dealing with the scenario where our temperature
a scenario where our ambient temperature is 20 degrees celsius
that does n't change
Given all of this information right over here , using Newton 's Law of Cooling , and using all of this information [E2]we[/E2] know about how bowls of oatmeal that start at this temperature have cooled in the past
you have paused the video ,
20 degrees
The most obvious thing to solve for or to apply
what happens with T of zero
it 's in degrees celsius
the e to the zero
That is going to be equal to when T equals zero
from both sides of this equation
with 80 minus 20
is 60 , is equal to C
that T , let me do that in magenta color
that T of t , that 's confusing , upper case T of lower case t , temperature as a function of time , is going to

That 's a time equals two

about how much power the vesting power grants

the question of whether Article Two is the exclusive series of presidential powers
a debate that continues to this day
into much more depth
President
into the electoral college system
No person except a natural born citizen
the main clauses
the main clause
in Section One of Article Two
The other stuff
just requirements of what you have to be in order to be President
about just the compensation of the President , can not be increased or diminished during the period for which he shall be elected , maybe to prevent him from giving himself a raise
Roberts
Obama
The fact that he slightly bungled it
into Section Two which is , I think , maybe , gets a little bit more involved
a declared war
since World War Two
a pretty important sentence
from the controversy over Supreme Court nominations
that the so - called advice and consent clause is really important
The advice and consent clause
to high officers
the clause
for inferior officers , Congress can vest the appointment in the President alone , in the courts of law or the heads of the department
they 're talking about inferior officers , [E2]they[/E2] 're not making any judgment about those peoples capability
they 're talking [E2]about inferior officers , they 're not making any judgment about those peoples capability
about inferior officers , they 're not making any judgment about those peoples capability , they 're more talking about a more junior , less senior officials in the government
about inferior officers , they 're not making any judgment about those peoples capability[/E2] capability , they 're more talking about a more junior , less senior officials in the government
an excellent point
that and the State of the Union power is really important

to this really core power , that he shall take care of the laws we faithfully executed
a big controversy over this clause
House
Senate
those crimes
And a lot of times in popular language ,
a super valuable overview
what 's really important about looking at a speech like this is not only that we can learn to analyze this as a primary source , which will be helpful for thinking about it historically , but also because I think it 's really useful to be able to look at a Presidential speech , or a speech given by any politician , and understand what kind of claims they 're making and how they 're making them
a primary source
lots of things
a photograph taken by someone who was , perhaps , attending a political rally
a diary of , maybe , someone who was active in the women 's rights movement in the 19th century
a shopping list
kind of the real meat of research material that shows you what people , at the time , were thinking
an artifact left behind by someone who was there
secondary
a secondary source
the work of digging up a bunch of primary sources
Lincoln
a book on Lincoln by Kim
my interpretation
just one way of looking at those primary sources where another historian might have a completely different interpretation
a much clearer picture of what Lincoln was really thinking
by reading his own words
that because he was there and because this is a speech delivered by him , that this speech of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is a primary source
Roosevelt
that you 've been dying to read this in your terrific impression of Roosevelt
the time to speak the truth , " the whole truth , frankly and boldly
from honestly facing conditions " in our country today
as a primary source and as a speech
the first thing we want to do , step one if you will , is just identify what 's going on
a speech given by the President
when it was , in March 4th , 1933
who gave this speech ,
Franklin Delano Roosevelt , just about to be inducted as President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt ,[/E2] , just about to be inducted as President
why he gave it ,
very important for Presidents when they take office to make an Inaugural Address
some basics
D.C.
1933
FDR
in our identification
that it 's a speech , it 's in D.C. , happened in 1933 , by FDR
our identification stage
liquor
Repeal has not come
in the United States
for sale and transport
in the greatest place
What is [E2]he[/E2] actually talking about
What is he actually talking about
in this speech
time to speak the truth
the American people
with candor
time to speak the truth , the whole truth , " frankly and boldly
that Americans need to meet the problem of the depression with like an up - welling of national will
it 's nice that he 's saying , " Look , I 'm gon na tell it like it is
that things are bad
that people were suffering
that it 's possible for us to bounce back if we are honest about the problems , and we address it with vigor
this is such a fascinating speech because , for one thing , this phrase has kind of come into our national lexicon , right
one of those things , like " Have your cake and eat it too
like chickens
the time to stand firm against nameless terror and focus on making the problems that we are facing into small , like accessible , combatable chunks
the stock market
by the rules of straight supply and demand
on confidence
The reason things are bad
because of this wave of nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror
It all
with that in mind
there is no one , probably other than their parents , who want those kids back in - person learning more than their teachers , and all of the counselors and the school nurse and everybody
there is no one [E2], probably other than their parents , who want those kids back[/E2] back in - person learning more than their teachers , and all of the counselors and the school nurse and everybody
, probably other than their parents , who want those kids back
that I even have to say that out loud is a little weird
Thousands
thousands
a horrible way to die
39
Medical professionals
that the most dangerous place to be in this global pandemic is in a closed , poorly ventilated building with lots of people crowding together , breathing on each other hour after hour , day after day , which is the description of my sixth grade classroom the year I had 39 kids
on any given day
that if someone coughed in the back of the room , I was gon na catch their cold
somebody coughs and I end up in the ICU
Somebody
on their best friend
his babysitter
with some
, there 's new information coming out all the time , this is still so new , but that we have people who say , kids ca n't get sick , kids are immune
that not only can kids get sick , not only can kids end up in the hospital , but a disproportionate amount of those kids who are ill are minority children
They 're black and brown children
from immigrant communities
at greater risk
in the schools with the oldest buildings , with the poorest ventilation , the most overcrowded classrooms
an excellent , very , very good sixth grade teacher
your kid in my sixth grade
an infectious disease medical professional
what Dr
anything different
the scientific community
you do n't even think about opening a school , a restaurant , a movie
to a rally
in more and more places
the community
that we have to articulate it because it makes so much sense
this plays out
there 's two questions
are there not one - size - fits - all solutions that could get us a little bit closer to this , whether it 's hybrid
outdoor learning
about disinfecting using some pretty specific things
by the way
'em
those 39 kids
that we have a protocol on disinfecting
the masks
all the desks
out of their hula hoop space
a toy
space helmets
to the moon
the plexiglass helmets
what they can
with what they have , which is n't a lot
here
I want people to know
those kids and their families
The teacher lives in the neighborhood
The teacher lives [E2]in the neighborhood
in the neighborhood , [E2]those kids and their families[/E2] families live in those neighborhoods
in the neighborhood[/E2] neighborhood , those kids and their families live in those neighborhoods
That school
a reflection of what 's going on in the broader community
in these classrooms that have poor ventilation that , even with your hula hoops , they 're gon na be passing each other in the hall
why the first thing
the most important part
All the hula hoops and face masks in the world
a surging virus rate
that 's what we 're worried about
that 's what we 're worried about , [E2]it[/E2] 's that folks are looking at this list , infection rates , masks , disinfectant , distancing
This is complicated
It 'll go away
it 's science
January
February
the outlier
in the United States of America
in questions like , what are you going to do , teachers , to make sure we can still keep them safe ?
just about teachers or students
about the community
This is just epidemiologically sound
trouble saying that word
for the entire community
Dr
Fauci
At which point
this massive logistical challenge of distributing hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine
to what degree they 'll work or how many people take it
the therapeutic lens where , hopefully , some therapies will come out in the January / February timeframe where COVID can be less deadly , less severe
to some of those things
the CEO of Novartis
on this livestream
it 's kind of a year that we 're in this world that you 've just described
yes , you prepare for the face masks and the disinfectant , and yes , we need all of these things
one of the things we said
and you do have to have simultaneously the ability for a school district to deliver distance learning
for all kinds of funding for a family to be able to bring Wi - Fi into their home
like indoor plumbing
that for granted that , well , everyone has
that for granted [E2]that[/E2] , well , everyone has
120,000
for the fun of it
medical experts
It was because infectious disease
this is a pandemic
a school
the worst place to do something like that
with people saying , what you got , I got ta do this tomorrow
third graders
that 's what a school is
that 's what [E2]a school is
a school is , [E2]it[/E2] 's a community
a school is[/E2] is , it 's a community
a village
that school nurse
It was frustrating
in May , people were saying , this is going in the wrong direction
This is not gon na be , okay
the warm weather would clear it all
some places that they should n't have
folks
into the bar
all of a sudden [E2]things[/E2] are spiking all over the country
okay , this is not going away
August
May
to some of these kids
paper packets of worksheets
worksheets
The only technology in some homes
mom 's telephone
on the telephone
chaos
in families
Nebraska
one of my colleagues
in some places , in Nebraska
with local television stations
about you 've got a $ 10 antenna on your old - fashioned TV , it 's not even cable
some of the TV stations
an hour where we could say , this is for younger grades , this is for middle school
some general project - based learning
whatever it takes
that some of the lawmakers , the people that have the purse strings , we wish that they would step up and see that they could be helping us instead of being the obstacle for getting something very important done
that a lot of school districts have been doing some heroic things , distributing tens or hundreds of thousands of devices
more social supports
There is
another element
how you deliver that in a world of COVID
Pollyanna
the order of operations
I know [E2]I[/E2] 'm talking about , you said like a magic wand or a blank check
Oregon Trail
like nobody 's business
that maybe , maybe I could upgrade
some educators who their specialty is distance learning
you have to deliver
the first time and the last time that we have some kind of emergency where kids , where they ca n't walk into that school building
with snow days
these horrible crises where the school got blown away
how important it is to have that technology in a child 's home so that they can do their homework , not just in case of a global pandemic
that the homework gap mimics the technology gap in that child 's living space in that child 's home
there are kids
who have wonderful tools
access
from anybody
for those kids , we fight for a kid 's access to a school nurse , a librarian , a counselor , the arts , the broad range of programs that every child needs
access not just to the equipment , that 's actually the easy part , but access to a professional who knows what she or he is doing to make sure that those kids who are learning that way are being taught well
my favorite way to teach
them to fall behind
them to be safe
the do
's and don'ts
a hug
those skills
that could look like
to your point , everyone 's been talking about just the social distancing , and do we open or close
about device access
it 's the same with older kids too , where they do n't plug in or they do n't engage
part of it
that we need to know how to develop better pacing and better lesson plans , and things that are meant to be engaging on that screen
Zoom
yesterday
for a lot of our teachers
, [E2]it[/E2] was all right , we 've got a free Zoom or we 've got a free something , and now go do whatever you were doing with your 35 kids yesterday , and now just do the same thing looking at them sitting in 35 different kitchens on their tablets and laptops
, it was all right , we 've got a free Zoom or we 've got a free something , and now go do whatever you were doing with your 35 kids yesterday , and now just do the same thing looking at them sitting in 35 different kitchens on their tablets and laptops
that that 's not the best pedagogy
that you have to engage kids and you have to ask them questions , and they have to be able to ask questions and interact with each other
NEA
some webinars for teachers that have never taught online that are saying , I just need a , I need a primer on this
the first thing about what this format can do
about strict , strict , strict beginners
nea.org/covidaction
at a screen
what I 'm doing when I 'm with those kids
to something that looks like that online
at what you 're doing , Sal , with your online experience
too many reporters who 've said , are you for closing the schools , are you going to ?
Those kids
They need us to deliver instruction
They need [E2]us to deliver instruction
us to deliver instruction , [E2]they[/E2] need us to deliver services
us to deliver instruction[/E2] instruction , they need us to deliver services
us to deliver lunch
along with all of those practical things
the ones that are begging the schools to please open up
our work
professionals
at it
a lot of sweat equity
a labor of love for us
for those parents
a magic wand
a state , the state of Maryland
a plan
their plan
look , we probably could open this building
Everyone
on how we 're gon na deliver those lunches and those homework packets
there are some kids who might not have mom and dad at home
a laptop
in - person instruction
the school laptop and tablets
your mom or dad
we 're gon na bring those kids in
sure that everybody has access to
that it 's not ready to open this school
teaching and learning going on
in more places than you think
hundreds of kids
We opened the school
they were supposed to , [E2]they[/E2] listened to medical experts
they were supposed [E2]to , they listened to medical experts
to , they listened to medical experts
parents , well , what can you do in your homes ?
a little more attention
of Maryland , actually [E2]I[/E2] had n't heard of it
a bit of a poster child for online learning or whatever else
pure distance learning
a good solution
for the great majority of students
we 're very aligned on this
just in the remaining time we have , what do you think , everything we 're describing
a suboptimal year
the education system or in society because of this ? - I really appreciate the gravity of that question
we ask it enough
The magical thinking of too many key political figures ,
lives
a sixth grade teacher
that advice
I understood ,
a scientist
these kids
to the bad judgment of too many politicians
a really tough job
about , well , look at all the folks that did n't get to go to their graduation party
about someone , you only get one year to be a first grader
one year to put the consonants and the vowels together and have it click and go I get it , this is called reading , oh , my Lord
the kids that we are going to prioritize the tools and the techniques and the programs that we 're gon na be doing with you that are going to incorporate the arts and sports and field trips
Funding [E2]for public schools
for public schools[/E2] schools has been miserable for so long
people who , well - meaningly , they will think they 're saying something real and they say , schools are the fundamental foundation of our economy
our best investment
four on the list
a human and civil right to an education
if that choir puts one dime into the economy
that child 's right
the foundation of our democracy of being
as a transactional piece of the economy
a ton
The whole world
through a very tough set of circumstances
it 's the issue of our day , you know , that and the economics
the education one
in a lot of ways
After their first year
the option to live away from campus
Estella
12 of these residence halls
Her department
a large simple random sample of first - year students who live in those 12 residence halls
about their overall satisfaction with campus living
the results of the survey
to which population
So Estella has done
a large simple random sample of first - year students
only those students who were surveyed
a simple random sample
more than just making statements about just the students who were surveyed
this one looks fair
the 12 best residence halls
the 12 that are closest to campus
to people who live in those residence halls
a large random sample of all people in that , in that , those 12 residence halls
which of these strategies would eliminate a variable in the system of equations
on the left hand side
we add these equations , [E2]we[/E2] have , on the left hand side , we have five x plus five x , which is going to be 10 x , and then you have negative three
we add these equations , we have , [E2]on the left hand side[/E2] side , we have five x plus five x , which is going to be 10 x , and then you have negative three
any variables
a variable
Negative six y
negative two y
the same question
Which of these strategies
a variable in the system of equations
Four x
six x
four x
from four x
the x
if we subtract negative eight y
to negative 22
the left hand side times 1/2[/E2] 1/2 , we distribute the one half
the left hand side times 1/2 , [E2]we distribute[/E2] distribute the one half
the left hand side times 1/2 , we distribute the [E2]one half
All right , let 's just multiply times 1/2
we distribute
one half[/E2] half is one way to think about it
one half is one way to think about it
the y
all three of these strategies
to positive five x
to a negative y
the heart of algebra
negative two times three
negative two times three[/E2] three is [E2]negative six x
add the equations , well , you immediately see when you add the x terms on the left hand side , they are going to cancel out
choice C.
a red disc spins with angular velocity omega , and a point on the edge moves at velocity V
angular velocity
A blue disc
with angular velocity two omega
which disc has a larger radius
a disc , this should be a perfect circle
that a point right over here has a velocity V
our angular velocity
omega
in this case , in terms of how fast it is rotating
the radius of the blue disc
that vector twice as tall
2V
the statement , which disc has a larger radius
that R is equal to the speed , magnitude of velocity
for this red disc
that R sub red is equal to V over omega
the same radius
an x
of two numbers that when I add them , I get six , and when I take their product , I get positive three
zero is equal to , let me rewrite the first part , x
something here that I 'm later going to subtract , so that what I have in parentheses is a perfect square
the way to make it a perfect square
we 've talked about this in other videos when we introduced ourselves to completing the square[/E2] square , is we 'll look at this first degree coefficient right over here , this positive six , and say , okay , half of that is positive three , and if we were to square[/E2] square that , we would get nine
That 's why [E2]we[/E2] added nine there
That 's why we added nine there
all right , we 're gon na be dealing with a three 'cause three is half of six
like this , zero is equal to x plus three squared minus six
the square root of both sides
that something squared is equal to six
the most obvious way
its name
to a molecule of benzene
just the word "
very little about what actually makes up this molecule
in that case , it might be useful to move up to the empirical formula
what does empirical mean
hey , you know , I from empirical evidence I now believe this , this means that you saw data
that you have some observations that make you think this new thing
an empirical formula
a ratio of the elements in the molecule
Now [E2]you[/E2] might say , OK , that 's nice , I now know that if I 'm dealing with benzene I have one carbon for every hydrogen or one hydrogen for every carbon , but
Now you might say , OK , that 's nice , I now know that if I 'm dealing with benzene I have one carbon for every hydrogen or one hydrogen for every carbon , but
how many of each of these
in a benzene molecule
the molecular formula for benzene ,
that each benzene molecule has six hydrogens
information
the ratio , OK , look , it 's a ratio of six to six , which is the same thing as one
as C one H one just like that
that that 's actually the case in one molecule , for every six carbons you have six hydrogens , which is still a one to one ratio
That may not satisfy you
well , OK , but how are these six carbons and six hydrogens actually structured
to a structural formula
A benzene molecule
six carbons in a hexagon
every other of these bonds on the hexagon
you have a double bond
you have [E2]a double bond
a double bond
Each of these carbons
to a hydrogen
this is a bond
it 's a covalent bond
in other videos on that
And this is only one variant of a structural
Oh , that 's about as good
there 's a hydrogen there
some structural formulas
This is one variant of a structural formula
Others might not be as explicit
for benzene ,
where the carbons are implicit as the vertex of each , there 's an implicit carbon at each of these vertices , and then you say , OK , carbon 's got ta have , not got ta , but it 's typically going to have four bonds in its stable state , I only see one , two , three
where the carbons are implicit as the vertex of each ,[/E2] , there 's an implicit carbon at each of these vertices ,[/E2] , and then you say ,[/E2] , OK ,[/E2] , carbon 's got ta have ,[/E2] , not got ta ,[/E2] , but it 's typically going to have four bonds in its stable state ,[/E2] , I only see one ,[/E2] , two ,[/E2] , three
a hydrogen
the convention that people use in organic chemistry
more and more and more information
A good example of that
an oxygen
A molecule of hydrogen , sorry , a molecule of water
exactly two hydrogens and , and one oxygen
Each of those oxygens in a water molecule
to two hydrogens
if we can find the limit as x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1 over the square root of x plus 5 minus 2
our first reaction
okay , well let 's just use our limit properties a little bit , this is going to be the same thing as the limit as x approaches negative 1 of x plus 1 over , over the limit , the limit as x approaches negative 1 of square root of x plus 5 minus 2
all right , this thing up here , x plus 1
all right ,[/E2] , this thing up here ,[/E2] , x plus 1
, all right ,
, [E2]all right ,
negative 1
for x
what does [E2]this[/E2] evaluate to
oh , look , there 's a zero in the denominator , maybe this limit does n't exist , maybe I 'm done here , what do I do ?
that your limit does not exist
the tool that we 're going to look at
is is there another way of rewriting this expression so we can evaluate its limit without getting the zero
a square root in the denominator
We know , we know that a plus b times a minus b is equal to a squared
We know , we know [E2]that[/E2] a plus b times a minus b is equal to a squared
in algebra
square root of x plus 5 plus 2
Your spider senses
is this ,
is this , is this definitely the same thing as what we originally had before we cancelled out the x plus 1s
a simplified version of g of x
For any input x , that g of x is defined
okay , well how does this help us ?
about this limit
if this is true of two ,
, if this is true of two functions , then the limit as x approaches , the limit , let me write this down , since we know this , because of this , we know that the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1 is going to be equal to the limit of g of x as x approaches negative 1 , and this of course is what we want to figure out , what was the beginning of the problem
, if this is true of two functions ,[/E2] , then the limit as x approaches ,[/E2] , the limit ,[/E2] , let me write this down ,[/E2] , since we know this ,[/E2] , because of this ,[/E2] , we know that the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1 is going to be equal to the limit of g of x as x approaches negative 1 ,[/E2] , and this of course is what we want to figure out ,[/E2] , what was the beginning of the problem
the limit of f of x
the limit of f of x as x approaches negative 1
if this little , this little , I guess you could say leap that I just made over here does n't make sense to you , think about it , think about it visually
g of x
G of x
something , something like this
In particular
about the cost and the duration of modern campaigns , especially in the United States
the cost
for inflation , [E2]the cost[/E2] cost has doubled for your average House campaign
all of the outside money , things like super PACs and whatever else
the last presidential campaign , in 2016
a good bit more than Donald Trump
a good bit more outside money
a several - fold increase in the cost of a campaign
is , what is the money for
is , is that , especially in a presidential campaign , and to a lesser degree in a congressional campaign , the campaigns have to pay professional , full - time staffers
on the staff
political consultants
all these people
polling
a lot of campaign advertising and marketing
the staff
about , well , what kind of advertising do we need to do ?
2008
a trend that[/E2] that has emerged really since the 2008 Obama campaign
a trend that has emerged really since [E2]the 2008 Obama campaign
On top of that
the 2008 Obama campaign[/E2] campaign is the increasing use of social media in campaigns
the 2008 Obama campaign is the increasing use of social media in campaigns
most of that energy
in mass media advertising
with social media
a message
to specific groups
your message
your base
social media ,
a lot less expensive than ,[/E2] , say ,[/E2] , TV advertising ,[/E2] , is becoming a bigger and bigger part of campaigns
the campaigns
In some countries
anywhere from two to six weeks
before the first caucus
Many people
that having such a long election cycle does n't allow a lot of focus on other things
you think about that
The equations below all
the same polynomial function , f of x
as negative 4 , times x minus 3 , times x minus 2 , times x plus 1 , times x plus 5
as negative 4 , times x[/E2] x minus 3 , times x[/E2] x minus 2 , times x[/E2] x plus 1 , times x[/E2] x plus 5
into two quadratic expressions
the thing just fully expanded out , multiplied out as a polynomial
about the end behavior here
an even exponent
it 's going to be similar to the shape of negative x squared
like the equation below
similar end behavior f of x
It 's an even exponent , or it 's an even degree
out in front of it
which form of f of x is most useful for finding zeroes
the most useful for finding 0s
that if we wanted to set this whole thing to be equal to 0 - - we said , hey , when does this equal 0 ?
these truths to be self - evident ,
an attempt to prevent things like this in the future , for nations to talk to each other and to coordinate so they do n't go to war , especially at the scale seen in World War I
part of the preamble
recognition of [E2]the inherent dignity and of the equal and unalienable rights of all members of the human family
the inherent dignity and of the equal and unalienable rights of all members of the human family[/E2] family is the foundation of freedom , justice , and peace in the world
disregard and contempt for human rights
in barbarous acts which have outrage the conscience of mankind
the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want
as the highest aspiration of the common people
the general assembly
this universal declaration of human rights
as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations
Why did they even have to write this
with reason and conscience

a map of who voted for this declaration
Who abstained
the countries that were n't part of the United Nations at the time
In gray
These articles
about people having the right to participate in a democracy , the right to be equal , that all people are equal , and in many of these countries , people did not have equal rights
severe discrimination
in places like South Africa
In many of these countries
a democracy
the civil rights movement
at the same time
ideas like apartheid
In many of the countries around the world , not just the orange ones but often in many of the green ones as well

a function of y
a huge hint here
we 're going to want to integrate with respect to y
this is , [E2]this[/E2] lower point of intersection right over here
this is , this lower point of intersection right over here
our lower bound in terms of y
our upper y bound
two curves intersect , and we look at the y - coordinates of those intersections , well , [E2]that[/E2] gives us two nice bounds for our integral

a little bit of mathematics
is going to be 27 divided by three is nine
all of that
Negative 18 plus nine is going to be negative nine , plus 36
this is going to be negative
His average speed
70 kilometers per hour
At that speed
five kilometers
for every liter of fuel that he uses
Fuel
.60 dollars per liter
the cost of fuel for the trip
that the trip is 100 kilometers long
that the average speed is 70 kilometers per hour
that at that speed , he can drive five kilometers for every liter of fuel that he uses
that fuel costs 0.60 dollars per liter
this last piece of information right over here
that written as 60 cents per liter
we 're going to have to use over those 100 kilometers
how much fuel I use per kilometer
how much the cost of our trip is
with just dollars
0.60
with 12 dollars
we 're done
the cost of our trip
what you 're thinking
the information right over here , that he 's traveling an average speed of 70 kilometers per hour
It 's true
in our calculation
they 're saying , [E2]they[/E2] 're traveling at 70 kilometers per hour , then at that speed , we get this fuel efficiency
they could have just told us , [E2]they[/E2] did n't even have to tell us this
they could have just told [E2]us[/E2] , they did n't even have to tell us this
that we could take a few minutes to talk about adaptation
to mind
you thought of , you 're right
adaptations
The word adaptation
to a trait that makes an organism more suited to its environment
the process by which a population becomes dominated by organisms that are suited to their environment
The point
that adaptation happens in a population as its organisms accumulate adaptations
this all
through the process of natural selection , which you may have heard about
With natural selection
organisms with beneficial heritable traits , increasing their share of the gene pool in the population because they 're more likely to mate and produce offspring
these well - adapted organisms have higher fitness , a measure of an organism 's ability to survive and reproduce in its specific environment
These traits or adaptations
the organisms better suited to survive and reproduce
natural selection
with the environment in which it takes place
Africa
Africanized
with honeybees adapted to life in Africa , sometimes called by the suboptimal names , Africanized honeybees or killer bees
the same species as
Populations of honeybees
to North America
nests
those concerns
the connection between adaptation and the environment
for literally millions of years
fish populations
something like laser eyes or teleportation
These spines
the stickleback
from birds and other predators
exactly what 's happening
Populations
by accessing a bottomless well of awesome problem - solving options
with natural selection as the driver
with the idea that if an increase in fitness is what natural selection is after , you do n't need an adaptation that allows you to incinerate all of your enemies
one good enough to solve whatever problem is keeping others in your population from surviving in mating

the reason why we see adaptations that look like natural selection just grabbed whatever happened to be lying around and modified it because it kinda did
Natural selection
the options currently in the genes of a population with the occasional addition of new genetic sequences through mutation to work with when a problem arises
Oh great !
Mutations , those will help !

what the other teachers are doing
we have some of this footage , if we could take a look at it fully pay , and if you could talk us through what 's going on
a Zoom call with
at this time I was just reading them a story about why they could n't be at school
Friday
one of our Friday dance parties here
a dance party
some grandma and grandpa residents
what we call the volunteers who live there watching us release our butterflies that we watched grow from caterpillars
On here
my students
some great teachers
to teaching and especially that group

What tips
for older siblings trying to help younger siblings with tutoring and homework in distance learning
so many students in my class who you can tell when they have n't had to like talk for themselves
older siblings
a list of things that they could do to be helpful , including being a good role model , like what does it look like when you are doing your own work , include your younger sibling in that time
, older siblings can be great models
that Carris is a pretty good older sibling
The very fact [E2]that they 're asking this question
that they 're asking this question[/E2] question shows that they care a lot so your younger siblings are very lucky Carris

How do you react to sassy kids
My kids
anything like that
that one of the first things you have to do as the adult in the situation is recognize your triggers
one of my triggers being talked to disrespectfully
if you react aggressively , they 're probably gon na react aggressively too , because aggression
you can either address that hurtful statement , I do n't like it when you talk that way to me
If you wanna speak to me , you can use kind words like , and give them an example , or [E2]I[/E2] can tell you 're really frustrated
If you wanna speak to me , you can use kind words like , and give them an example , or I can tell you 're really frustrated
a few minutes to calm down
powerful advice , not just for dealing with young kids
any relationship feelings are real , do n't escalate--
I mean [E2]I[/E2] was joking obviously I am always trying to navigate
I think [E2]I[/E2] fall into that trap as a parent does , if like your child is not eating or whatever , and you 're trying to push them and then they kinda dig in their heels , and I think they 're trying to push boundaries a little bit
remaining calm is the most important thing in that moment
like me asking a child , if it 's okay , if I can hug them or hold them or hold their hands and just doing some deep breaths
at that moment

about religion or about , things that are n't really my place to comment on , I mean , even politics at preschool sometimes
everybody believes different things
something you might wanna ask your mom and dad about , or your grandma about your caregiver , whoever they live with when you get home
that I might just say , " Let 's talk about that

my advice
a huge fan of conscious discipline
by reading the book " Easy to Love , Difficult to Discipline " by Dr
in any kind of like partnership or promotion I just love-- - Conscious discipline
That book
my life
one big thing to do
first you have to teach them sort of what feelings are , right
But it is okay to be angry , your feelings , give us information
calming strategies like deep breathing , maybe coloring a picture when you 're feeling overwhelmed or getting a hug from a person that you love
what you 're saying
that like , they 're not real
So this is a question [E2]I[/E2] 've been getting a lot
So this is a question I 've been getting a lot

with the short attention spans that younger kids have
how do you keep them engaged when teaching online
five to 10 minutes max is the attention that you can keep online as you can see it is ( indistinct )

that really helps just having that routine and the expectation set
positive energy
if you see it at the preschool level
from Facebook Munah Yusuf is asking how do you encourage kids to report bullying
of the idea that bullying is still a huge problem
it 's a little more invisible than it used to be because it 's become more like cyber bullying or online
one huge thing we have to work on
relationships between our students
Becky Bailey
is that willingness comes from connection
it 's the job of teachers at every level to be building classroom community within their school
It is a part of every day
It is [E2]a part of every day
a part of every day , [E2]it[/E2] is a part of every subject that we are looking for ways to teach kids to see others with love and empathy
a part of every day[/E2] day , it is a part of every subject that we are looking for ways to teach kids to see others with love and empathy

Newtrap Nation
from YouTube
what do you think about the way we are learning during COVID-19
that teachers , administrators , everyone is doing their absolute best
the expectations that we put on families and on students to have kids doing this synchronous learning experience , six hours a day from home , it 's not sustainable , it 's not feasible and it 's burning a lot of people out
the time that less is more so that you have more space for families to just take care of everything else and not atrophy
that the teachers are feeling pressure from the state and I guess then the districts that hey I got ta cover this many standards and this many days , and they 're saying you have to have this much face time in person
some " in person video conference " makes sense
that what they 're expecting is kind of six hours of learning time and so some teachers are really able to do , certain amount of minutes together online , and then some of the stuff on your own
The reality we 're facing
that some students are home alone , or they do n't have someone helping keep them in a routine or older siblings or the caregiver
some teachers are feeling pressure because of that to be more present in those student lives
most of the pressure is just coming from regulations
some schools
enough staff to do anything except for let kids do synchronous learning
So I 'm gon na be teaching in class
time for maybe one last question
I love technology
in some ways
our world a lot smaller
the biggest most important thing when connecting kids online , is not just giving them FaceTime with me
the biggest most important thing when connecting kids online[/E2] online , is not just giving them FaceTime with me
setting up small groups and I 've seen several teachers do this and they do things like lunch buddies and every day of the week different groups of three or four students will meet and have lunch together then kids are more likely and that 's virtually , kids are more likely to open up in a smaller group , especially our older ones and with our younger ones , there are a lot more likely to be validated and heard because they have lots of things to share online
that any opportunity you have to decrease the size of the groups that you 're working with , you should definitely take , because that is something that will help build those bonds
into what you 're talking about around attention span , et cetera
We 're all out of time
I said , [E2]I[/E2] do n't say so you could watch the other films of other people that we 've
any just final messages for either parents who are especially parents of four or five year old struggling right now
the main thing that I would say
For teachers
all eyes
Okay , we have a big audience , whether we like it or not
for the first time
on school
you to advocate right now and also hang in there because you 're doing your best
what I wanna say to families
a big , big , big change in the way your lives have operated
together we 'll see it through
that 's totally true
great advice
after you saying that
- Thank you , well , thanks everyone
y' all probably felt
Some of which [E2]we[/E2] just touched on
on Tuesday
on Tuesday on the Homeroom Livestream
The number B
five less than twice the number C
two times C minus five
five less than two times the number C
The product of B and C
So this one we have [E2]45[/E2] is equal to BC
45C
this is a different equation
45 is equal to B over C
45C equals B
on the first of these equations
2C minus five
exactly what I wrote here
that this last one is n't going to work
like saying that B is equal to 2C plus 10 , which is clearly different than this first equation that I wrote up here

about another way that we could have tackled it
the value of z
Another way [E2]we could have done it
we could have done it[/E2] it , is we could have constructed a line right over here

a plus 20 ,
Then you add [E2]that[/E2] to y ,
the interior , some of the interior angles of this larger triangle

in creation of separate cells
your meiosis one
a lot of analogs with mitosis in general
me to describe two events
mitosis and meiosis
good things to know in detail
this is sufficient for part a
at least two events that are common to both mitosis and meiosis
The genetic composition of daughter cells produced by mitosis
from that of the daughter cells produced by meiosis
the most obvious one ,
mitosis ,[/E2] , mitosis involves one division
Meiosis
to two daughter cells from mitosis , and four daughter , daughter cells from meiosis
a pretty big difference between the two
the daughter cells from meiosis
half the number of chromosomes
a haploid number of chromosomes
The daughter cells in meiosis
daughters
mitosis [E2]daughters[/E2] have diploid
mitosis daughters have diploid
diploid , daughters have diploid number
diploid , daughters have diploid[/E2] diploid number
the two strongest differences
about other things
about crossing over occurring in meiosis but not in mitosis
about the separation and independent sortment of homologous chromosomes that you have
into arbitrary detail
that they only have to list two in each of these , in each of these parts of question four

my variable of integration
approximately 1.595
one of the key things about normal distributions
we assume that they 're the sum or they can be viewed as the sum of a bunch of independent
in a lot of situations
the mall
9 %
a binomial variable
a reasonably big difference
that these numbers get closer and closer to each other all the way so that if you have 10,000 people in your population and you 're only doing three trials that the numbers get very , very close
12.49 something

that ionic compounds have significant covalent character when a cation has a polarizing effect on a large anion
what are [E2]they[/E2] talking about
And actually ,
your nucleus
of your cation
a positive nucleus
a large anion
an electron cloud
the anion
one way to think about
these electrons that are out here
Negative charges
a polarizing effect
These things
So you 're gon na have more of the electrons and more of the negative charge hanging out over here than on the right
as a result
that salts composed of small cations and large anions should have relatively low melting points
Let 's see , these are all salts here , and if these were to disassociate , or if [E2]you[/E2] think about what the cations would be , the cations , the cations that make up , that make up these compounds
Let 's see , these are all salts here , and if these were to disassociate , or if you think about what the cations would be , the cations , the cations that make up , that make up these compounds
lithium , lithium
iodide
we see lithium , sodium , and potassium
group one elements
shells
of these
the smallest
that since iodine is larger than fluorine , well iodide , which is when they gain an electron , it 's gon na be larger than fluoride
lithium - iodide
a case of small cation , small cation and large , and large anion
Lithium iodide
a great example of that
the lowest melting point of everyone on the table
that combination
the highest , that has the highest melting point
two that are good to compare
that their melting point 's , their melting point 's , melting point 's consistent with hypothesis
melting point
the lowest melting point , which completely typified what the student was saying as having a low melting point , as we looked at the highest melting point which had a larger cation and a smaller anion
all of these halides
the iodine
like a good candidate
The fluoride
like an interesting candidate
we 've already dealt with the sodium fluoride
sodium fluoride
So we 're gon na focus on [E2]sodium fluoride[/E2] fluoride ,
So we 're gon na focus on sodium fluoride ,
what we select
We select sodium fluoride
a compound that can be dissolved in water to produce a basic solution
that is going to be in
HF in our aqueous solution ,
this was an iodide right over here , then this reaction
in that direction
some kind of nice equilibrium

areas , and we 're talking about what type of areas ? Well , [E2]these[/E2] are areas where deer roam freely
areas , and we 're talking about what type of areas ?[/E2] ? Well , these are areas where deer roam freely
with this relative pronoun
the type of areas
in areas roamed by deer freely
et cetera
Instead of saying deer roam freely
Most writers
the passive voice you should avoid it , unless you really need to , unless it really does something special to what you 're writing
because of that passive voice
the same problem
The adverb
in front of the roamed
in the passive voice
Both of these
in the passive voice , which in general you should avoid
a where
with an
in which , where in this case the which is the relative pronoun

in areas in which deer roam freely
The problem I have with [E2]this one
this one[/E2] one is this part
the problem here
we have the relative pronoun which , but we 're not saying how do we relate
to those areas that we 're referring to

So , this is part a , so let 's , let me draw the activated olfactory sensory neuron , so , it might , so those are [E2]its dendrites , there , so , I 'm not gon na draw a perfect , so those are its dendrites right over there , and
its dendrites , there , so , I 'm not gon na draw a perfect , so those are its dendrites right over there , and this is its axon
its dendrites , there , so , I 'm not gon na draw a perfect , so those are its dendrites right over there , and[/E2] and this is its axon
And [E2]I[/E2] could draw other details if I want
And I could draw other details if I want
you 'd have to draw all of these details on the actual test
the activated olfactory sensory neuron
one of its dendrites
the interneuron , drawing its dendrites , and then its axon
the synapse , where we have to transmit the signal between the two , so if we zoom in , if we zoom in , right over there , we would see the axon terminal of the sensory neuron
the synapse
the zoomed in of the synapse
this activation potential that is going to go down the axon
these neurotransmitters
in , in these , these vessels
You could draw the myelin sheath and all of that
You could draw [E2]the myelin sheath and all of that
the myelin sheath and all of that , [E2]you[/E2] could draw the nuclei of the different cells
the myelin sheath and all of that[/E2] that , you could draw the nuclei of the different cells
the next neuron
a given protein
Maybe , maybe one
multiple molecules
this could lead to many combinations , combinations being detected
that , this could lead to many combinations being detected
the half - equivalence point
the half - equivalence point[/E2] point is [E2]the point[/E2] point at which half of the potassium sorbate has been converted to the sorbic acid
the concentrations of the potassium sorbate and the sorbic acid are equivalent
1.7
to pH
the K - a of sorbic acid
to the pH at the half - equivalence point
all the formulas that I 'm using here in the first couple of pages of the free - response section , and even a whole bunch of formulas on equilibria and all of these different notations they use
the one that might show up that looks interesting
this one right over here that you might recognize as the Henderson - Hasselbalch equation
straight out of the definition of K - a
a relationship
the half - equivalence point[/E2] point , the pH
at [E2]the half - equivalence point
the p - K - a
about K - a we 're thinking about the dissociation constant for the acid
the p - K - a , I take the negative log of
the negative log of this
all these formulas
on the first page
times ten to the
you 're calculator
a log button that defaults to base ten
log , base ten , of that
So , this is approximately , approximately , 4.77 So
me just do it like this
the derivative of the left - hand side with respect to x
the derivative of this expression
the derivative of three y squared
the derivative of three y[/E2] y squared
with respect to y
for the second derivative of y
that , what we wanna figure out , our second derivative , when y is equal to one
that 's dy dx

that a race car driver has 28 cars
Each car
four tires
22 tires
the key word here
estimate
estimating
something we 'll do throughout our lives
28 cars
each car
28 times four
he has to replace all the tires on the cars
the number that he would have to replace
you would say 28 times four
he needs to replace
hey , what 's a friendlier number than 28 ?
so if I say , hey , 28 is pretty close to 30
our way of making the 28 a little bit friendlier
22 is approximately , roughly equal
what these squiggly equal signs mean
what these squiggly equal[/E2] equal signs mean
that this thing up here is roughly equal to
, he roughly has
Three times four

our amazing Chief Learning Officer
an expert in learning science
that raising teenagers is difficult
that means [E2]that[/E2] sometimes it 's really hard to know what 's going on with them and they 're trying on new identities and they 're trying new things
that I have all the answers today
some strategies that maybe you have n't thought of before , other things to
with that disclaimer
through the tips that are based on research and what we know
some of the questions that you guys are putting into the questions piece on the webinar
the research about motivation and think about , okay , what is the big thing ? What are the big takeaways
the research about motivation and think about , okay , what is the big thing ? [E2]What[/E2] are the big takeaways
one of the tricks with teenagers
that the things they value are changing and sometimes they 're not communicating the things that they value anymore
it difficult to think about how do you help them increase their perceived value of an activity
about ways to use that lever of value and also ways that we can help our students feel like they 're gon na be successful
on doing one or both of these things
of other ways that you can help students be successful or help them really see value in the activities that they 're being asked to do in school
the reason it 's related to success
because nothing makes you feel like you can be successful as having had some success[/E2] success in the past
just in changing the mindset
more than a week
more than [E2]a week
even at this age
a week[/E2] week is a long time to kind of be able to move through
a week is a long time to kind of be able to move through
when you 've met them
to the next piece , celebrate success
sure that that 's a big message that they 're getting
your tone of voice
high fives and hugs
about tangible rewards
about ways to celebrate when students do meet their goals and also take that as a time to reflect
What did they do that helps them be successful ?
both with setting goals and reflecting
as a parent
the other piece of reflection
about what happens , what happened when they maybe ran into trouble or got stuck a little bit
to the third tip
particularly with distance learning
to a place where they just do n't know what to do next
about managing roadblocks
the week , [E2]that[/E2] 's the time to talk about
the week , that 's the time to talk about
are your goals for the week , [E2]that[/E2] 's the time to talk about , so what are you gon na do when you get stuck ?
are your goals for [E2]the week , that 's the time to talk about[/E2] about , so what are you gon na do when you get stuck ?
the indicators that you have when it 's okay to ask you for help
from their teacher
a good strategy
From there
about emphasizing that effort leads to success
lots of kids
by early teens
some perceptions of things they 're just not good at
on the Academy website
a course called growth mindset
those neurons
new , [E2]those neurons[/E2] neurons form new connections with each other
same
with lifting weights
your muscles
that in the research that when kids start to understand a little bit about actually there 's biology basis for trying things and working on things that are kind of hard for you , that actually motivates them to think " Oh , I can be successful
at this thing that I 'm doing
that learning
hard work
the fourth piece
with teens and preteens
some work
their eyes
important pieces to think about how do we establish that relevance
you observing them
about rewards
a lot of questions from parents , like , " Is this bribing my kid ? I do n't wanna bribe them to do their work
we all use rewards
I know [E2]I[/E2] use rewards for myself sometimes
I think about that when [E2]I[/E2] have to do a lot of writing and it 's kind of going slowly , I 'll say , " If I just finished this page , I can give myself a Hershey 's kiss
I think [E2]about that[/E2] that when I have to do a lot of writing and it 's kind of going slowly , I 'll say , " If I just finished this page , I can give myself a Hershey 's kiss
a little bit of boost
a reward
that little boost that gets them started
that little boost
with their friends
on the computer
the movie
with your kid
about using rewards to get things going , keep them
your student
Yeah , a trip to Disney world
small things
something they either earn , or they have no chance of ever earning again
It should be okay if you did n't earn it this time
a new goal
about things
some of the big tips and ideas for thinking about generally again , thinking about this balance of how can we help kids think they 'll be successful and how can we help them value the activities we 're asking them to do
a lot of great questions
a couple of questions come in
Question
from the Person S
our older kids not to play games on their school issued devices without policing them constantly
about blocking some of these sites
an issue
Minecraft
Fortnight
for younger kids , it 's probably Minecraft , for the middle kid is probably Fortnight
the among us game
the Congress people playing among us the other day
if I 'm gon na keep hitting on this goals piece
about , okay , if I 'm doing this , does that get me off track to meet the thing that I need to do
with those are
good ways to think about teaching moderation , think about teaching a little bit of that , kind of control of what they 're doing
this is a really rewarding and interesting thing for me
something that they 're probably gon na work for because that 's where it is
more like turning up the dial on some of the schoolwork and letting them have pieces of the game at different times when it 's appropriate and help them figure out how to make a schedule that fits into to help those work
the suggestion of turning it into part of the incentives piece
Nun
a question from Nun who asks , it 's related to the goal
the goal , the question
how do you convince the kid that achieving the goal will lead to success
one thing
to set up meeting the goal itself is success
Like meeting [E2]that[/E2] goal itself , like doing 35 practice problems and meeting polynomials
Like meeting that goal itself[/E2] itself , like doing 35 practice problems and meeting polynomials
a success in itself
that itself an end point for them
that 's really good that
that piece
that piece that then makes them feel like , " Hey , so next week the math challenge is gon na be adding and subtracting polynomials
Arlene
a question from Arlene
a parent of a high school and a middle school counselor
A lot of our students
with depression and anxiety from being in the house since last March
that I 've experienced a little bit of that too , during these last eight months
the first thing I would say
some amount of just being mildly depressed and a little bit anxious is pretty normal in these kinds of times
professional help
the way this was written was being in the house
The next piece is that exercise piece like moving
breaks in their school day where they are getting up and moving and walking
this is do
, this is do as I say , not as I do , I 'm the worst
, [E2]this is do[/E2] do as I say , not as I do[/E2] do , I 'm the worst
in my chair here
for like eight hours
the final thing that teens really struggle with
a question from Barbara , who 's asking advice for kids who strive for perfection , who are super motivated but they are also , they kind of are worried about doing things that are imperfect and that experience in itself overwhelms them
those students
failure
how we learn
us learn
games
for all the talk about games
Dennis
for different routines in the day
work from home
What advice
Kids
on routine and knowing what to expect and what 's gon na come next
it has to be always the exact same thing
a look at it
like they know what 's coming , then [E2]you[/E2] can flex a little bit like other things , like what are they wearing
even schools do this
If you remember back too when your kids were in elementary schools ,
it 's crazy day
pajama day
All of those things
really good flexes to make in the routine so it does n't just become monotonous
you also talked about classes lounging on the futon
mixed feelings about that
I 'm on now
But one class
on the futon
for myself personally
I know for myself personally [E2]I[/E2] 've been in this room for eight months
I know [E2]for myself personally[/E2] personally I 've been in this room for eight months
once a month I decide to go to the kitchen or the dining room and try to change things up just a little bit
a follow - up about the rewards and incentives
Kiki
Fortnite
I 've used Fortnite as reward in the past but they find that my son rushes through his work in order to quickly get to playing this game
them to understand that it 's not just the quantity but actually the quality of the work that is important
RAF
the reward
if they were right or wrong
a matter of trying to set that goal for quality
something that you can look at and see if he 's met a quality standard great
this is one challenge that I remember as a kid
this puts burden on parents
we have time for maybe one or two more
a really good question from Ranga
These recommendations
the assumption here is that you have to be kind of with your child the whole time
part of your recommendations that allows you to free up some of that time
to how do you kind of balance the engagement and the time that as a parent , you have to do your day job
we 're asking way too much with parents right now
that what you wanna do is think about how you can structure the day so that they have set things they 're supposed to do at set times
check - ins
about positive reinforcement
for the next hour
hourly check - ins
our goal for the next two hours
that feeling of success
we have time for one more
Linda
Anika
a couple of questions around the same theme , which is from Linda and Anika
what ideas do you have for students who sees zero value in school ?
about having them access to peers
kind of the social piece
The other piece for kids who just do n't see [E2]the value of school
the value of school[/E2] school is the toughest thing about teenagers is probably for those who it 's tough to figure out what they are interested in
baking
Whatever
they 're interested in
all the time we have for questions
you all you busy parents out there
it 's an incredibly busy time and you 're balancing a lot

the last part
on the next video
about what word ( mumbles ) you 'd be considered blank , if you 're deliberately defying an oppressive hierarchical society
an oppressive hierarchical society
the word defies
with the word rebel
impulsive
that you do n't think before you act , you just do something
in a lot of different ways
artists
well industrious
you 're
like a tyrant
kind of the opposite of a tyrant
A tyrant
someone who would run the oppressive hierarchical society
I was doing this under time - pressure , I got to
that feels right
against the hierarchical society
The range of colors that homeowners could use on the exterior of their houses
by the community 's stringent rules regarding upkeep of property
about the range of colors that homeowners could use on the exterior of their house
strict rules
the way I 'm thinking of this
Stringent rules
the range of colors
stringent rules are n't going to bolster
stringent rules are not going to embellish a range of colors
stringent rules
like the type of rules[/E2] rules that they would n't try beat around the bush
to the point
cultivated
that you 're helping to kind of develop
You 're cultivating a garden
you 're really fostering it
you 're really fostering it , [E2]you[/E2] 're giving it nutrition
you 're really fostering it , you 're giving it nutrition
you 're really fostering it[/E2] it , [E2]you 're giving it[/E2] it nutrition
like something that would try to cultivate a range of colors
The one I have in mind
an x component of , let 's see not nine
I 'm just a sucker for symmetry when I choose examples
how the two dimensional curl , the 2D curl of a vector field , of a vector field v which is a function of x and y
through the reasoning for why this is true
in this particular case when [E2]we[/E2] start evaluating that
in this particular case when we start evaluating that
by looking at partial of q with respect to x
at the second component
whatever the partial derivative of p with respect to y is
that derivative of y cubed minus nine
this right here
our two dimensional curl
this vector field that I showed you
exactly the one that I used when I was kind of animating the intuition behind curl to start off with , where I had these specific parts where there is positive curl here and here but negative curl up in these clockwise rotating areas
why that 's the case here and why I chose this specific function for something that 'll have lots of good curl examples
a negative nine
instead , so x equals zero , y equals three
's take a look at where that is
three times y squared
this whole part
zero minus nine
that equals negative 27
what corresponds to the clockwise rotation that we have going on in that region
how if you plug in zero
that every single point
just by taking this formula that we found for 2D curl , and plugging in the corresponding values of x and y
a very powerful tool
it involves an integral
it 's going to involve f prime
given us
so much information about f prime including its graph and the area under or above the curve of the different integrals
us to find f of four and f of negative two
straight out of the fundamental theorem of calculus
instead of having a b
f of x , we could add f of a
to solve for f of x , we could add f of a to bought sides
to solve for [E2]f of x , we could add f of a[/E2] a to bought sides
the u one
some letter other than x
f of a
the sides
a general form
that f of one , f of one is equal to three
this is one right over here
that this is going to be equal to three
f of x , f of x is equal to the integral
as my a
From one
what that is
the first part of the problem
to four
the integral from one to four of f prime , [E2]that[/E2] 's the curve
The function
below the horizontal axis
this area , which they told us in the problem , the area bound by the x - axis in the graph of f prime over the interval one , four
this area over here
negative 12 plus three
the bounds
the integral from negative to the one
that this area over here is nine
that the integral would evaluate to be negative nine
the area
the curve
below the x - axis
the integral

the observed activity pattern of the mutant mice under L12 : D12 conditions and under DD , continuous darkness conditions , [E2]that[/E2] would support the claim that light overrides the genetically - controlled circadian rhythm
under some mutant mice , mutant mice , under , so let me make two columns , mutant mice under L12 , L12 : D12 , and then under continuous , continuous darkness
they do n't have
they do n't have , [E2]they[/E2] have some
they do n't have[/E2] have , [E2]they have[/E2] have some
they do n't have , they have some
genes that control circadian rhythm
They did n't get
a gene that somehow makes them not sensitive to light
under the L12 : D12
what I would expect
to the light and the darkness
I would guess that a mutant mouse that has no , that does n't have some of these genes for circadian rhythm
I would guess that a mutant mouse that has no , that does n't have some of these genes [E2]for circadian rhythm
for circadian rhythm , well , for them
for circadian rhythm[/E2] rhythm , well , for them
it 's just gon na be
it 's just gon na be , [E2]it[/E2] 's just gon na be random
it 's just gon na be , it 's just gon na be random
it 's just gon na be[/E2] be , [E2]it 's just gon na be[/E2] be random
my predictions that I would see for mutant mice in either of these
mice
In nature
potential prey for some predatory birds that hunt during the day
you could say that 's one , that 's one feature of our model , that you 're just more likely to be eaten if you 're active when the birds are hunting
if you 're more likely to be eaten , then you 're less likely to reproduce
Potassium sorbate
a molar mass of 150 grams per mole
this decimal
Even the zero
a significant digit
the way [E2]we think about ionic equations
we think about ionic equations[/E2] equations is we think about well , if these are dissolved in water , it 's an aqueous solution , these are going to disassociate into their , into ions
on both of the , on both the reactant and the product side
sorbic acid
care so far of that
the ionic equation
the ions
on the reaction , on the reactant side
potassium ions

the concentration
At what point
an equal concentration of potassium sorbate and sorbic acid
equal concentrations
at the half - equivalence point
4.77
at a pH of , we actually figured it out before , 4.77
to the half - equivalence point where these two things are going to have equal concentrations
the way to think about this soft drink
something it might not have
this soft drink
most of our things that we care about
in the form
Most of the sorbic acid
in its acid[/E2] acid form
you could say it the other way
Most of [E2]the sorbate
the sorbate[/E2] sorbate has become the conjugate acid

the next student
that half
you get--
You see the general idea here
one - sixteenth
what we actually picked
Point O
the center of both circles in the figure above
the circumference of the larger circle is 36 , so the circumference of the larger circle there is 36 , and the radius of the small circle is half the radius of the larger circle , [E2]what[/E2] is the length of the darkened arc
for what that radius is
the larger circle
The smaller circle
a radius half of the radius of the larger circle
The smaller circle 's radius
radius
The circumference here
It might have already jumped out at you
Hey , okay , if I have a radius here " of 36 and if I have a circumference here of 36 " and if I have a circle with half the radius , " its circumference is going to half that
what they 're asking us
just the circumference of the smaller circle
what is the arc length
This 80 degrees
80/360 of the entire circle right over here , or the entire circumference
80/360
the same thing as , let 's see , then divide both of them by 10
the same thing as 8/36
eight divided by four
is two
with , let 's see , 18 divided by nine is two

Given the cost of a hardcover book , the price of it typically hovers around $ 25

When will the paperback be out
we 're talking about
about the cost of a hardcover book
The price of it
around $ 25
given the cost of a hardcover book , which typically hovers around $ 25
Given the cost of a hardcover book
at a price around $ 25
about the cost , which does something
the exact meaning that we want
In that
this prepositional phrase
a very strange thing
about something in the plural
Given the cost of a hardcover book , which typically hovers around $ 25
through part 1 ,
based on this diagram above
the free - body diagrams , which will help us determine the acceleration of block 2
it 's going to accelerate downwards
The other way to think about it
the weight of block 2 is larger than the upward force of tension
a sense of things
from Newton 's 2nd Law
that if we pick a direction
All the forces
in either the upwards or downwards direction
So , the magnitude of our net forces , we care about the vertical dimension here , is going to be equal to the mass times the acceleration , in that , in that dimension , in that direction
you could say
the net forces
in the downward direction
tension
So we 're gon na have m2 g , the weight , minus the tension
So we 're gon na have m2 g , the weight[/E2] weight , minus the tension
against the weight
that same blue color
by m2
for acceleration in terms of m2 g and T
any m1s
in terms of m2 , T , and g
that T minus , we know that the tension is larger than the weight , T minus m1 g is going to be equal to is equal to m1 , is going to be equal to m1 times the magnitude of the acceleration
these magnitudes
that the magnitudes of the tension are the same
two equations with two unknowns
by just adding the left - hand side
in algebra 1
the magnitude of the acceleration of either block 1 or block 2
wait , there might be an easier way to think about this problem
well , this would be analogous , it 's not the exact same thing , but it would be analogous to imagine , two , these two blocks floating in space
m2
to m1
With a force of m2 g
about the magnitude here
what I have just kind of drawn
as one combined mass , of m1 plus m2
with a magnitude of m1 g
the acceleration here
Force divided by mass
acceleration
by our mass , which is going to be which is going to be m1 plus m2 , that 's going to give you your acceleration
as a simpler way of thinking about it
either of them
the exact same answer
That 's one of the fun things about science
to the same point
a teacher bought 12 sheets of stickers to use on the homework of her students
Each sheet
48 stickers
the best estimate for the number of stickers the teacher used
the first thing to appreciate
we just have to figure out an estimate
12 sheets of stickers
if we calculate [E2]that[/E2] first , the number to start , we subtract out the number that are remaining
12 [E2]I[/E2] can work with
123
a friendlier number
I 'll say that 's roughly
what this is in our heads or with a little bit of paper
600
12 times five
500
480
600 , if we had 100
We could 've chosen , instead of 123 becoming 120 in our estimate
the closest to that estimate
Which of [E2]the following indicators
the following indicators[/E2] indicators would be the best choice for determining the end point of the titration
which of these indicators
the pH at the equivalence point is 2.54 , well [E2]which of these indicators[/E2] indicators have the closes pKa to that
just an opportunity to still
for their sake
that you take care of yourself
that you give your mind a break , and be in the moment , in a moment of stillness and acceptance
A researcher
that in a certain organism , the complete metabolism or glucose
The energy released from the total oxidation of glucose under standard condition
686 kilocalories per mole
The energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate under standard conditions
7.3 kilocalories per mole
how much energy is released when you hydrolyze that ATP per mole
the energy released from the hydrolysis of ATP , let me underline that
7.3
21.9
219
30 times 7.3
in a different color
I might get the benefit of multiple colors
Efficiency
actually let me do it , well , efficiency is equal to energy is going to be energy in ATP , energy stored in ATP , over total energy , total energy from oxidation , energy from oxidation of glucose
what the energy production when you oxidize one mole of glucose
it is 686 kilocalories per mole
The complete metabolism of glucose
30 molecules of ATP
for every mole of glucose
30 moles of ATP
that 's going to be 219 kilocalories
686

12 minus six
approximately 32 % efficiency
describe what happens , I want this in another color for fun
to , what happens to the other 68 % of the energy
The rest of the energy
as heat
it 's also released as entropy , increasing the number of possible states of the cells , more things are bouncing around in different ways
this is the easiest way to think about it
it 's usually going to be

all the pieces that are going to make up that third degree polynomial
plus 1/2 minus 1 1/2 which would give you negative two and then plus three , plus , no , sorry , 1/2 minus 1 1/2 which would be negative one plus three is positive two plus two x to the third power

okay , I only need the third degree
That 's super hard
two infinite polynomials
So we could say 3 times our number x
to 3 halves so now we just have to solve for x so if we want to isolate an x here on the left hand side , the most obvious thing to do is 3 times x , if we divide by 3 , we 're gon na left with just x [E2]We[/E2] ca n't just do that to one side of the equation
to 3 halves so now we just have to solve for x[/E2] x so if we want to isolate an x[/E2] x here on the left hand side , the most obvious thing to do is 3 times x[/E2] x , if we divide by 3 , we 're gon na left with just x[/E2] x We ca n't just do that to one side of the equation

One plus one
that this right over here is going to be my answer
all of this stuff
to negative two , then [E2]all of this stuff[/E2] stuff boils down to that
The left - hand side
just x plus one
that means [E2]that[/E2] x is equal to negative one , and negative one is a non - zero integer
at these other ones
of two integers that
two numbers , whose product is one and whose sum is positive one , well , [E2]I[/E2] needed two integers

on the work we 've already seen with allele frequencies
large populations , so many
that we have stable allele frequencies
us to start thinking about things like homozygotes and heterozygotes
each of these terms
p squared
the same thing as p
the frequency of your dominant allele
the frequency of your dominant
Well ,
the probability for someone in the population to be homozygous dominant
q
by the same logic
this middle term
the probability of being a heterozygote
a pretty neat result
Just by making a few assumptions , and reasoning through this notion of allele frequency
these all
it all[/E2] all makes sense
it all makes sense
to one
many videos
intermolecular forces
something that we would like to take into consideration
for P
So [E2]we[/E2] could view this as a modified ideal gas law equation
So we could view this as a modified ideal gas law equation
into account
the fact that these particles have some real volume to them
that in many cases those intermolecular forces are attractive forces , and so they would take away from the pressure
some term that accounts for that , a term that accounts for taking away the pressure due to intermolecular forces
what some of y' all are thinking
if they all have a strong negative charge , they wanna get away from each other as far as they can
to the pressure
in terms of how concentrated are the particles generally
n over v squared
that pressure plus a times n over v squared
based on how large on average those molecules or those particles are
a pretty good competence equation for when we 're dealing with more real gases , ones that have intermolecular forces , and one where the actual particles have volume
And this actually does a pretty good job ,
there 's a name for [E2]it[/E2] ,
there 's a name for it ,
it , you could see it written like this
a two variable function , f of xy
These two terms
what you might call the linear
the end , which is kind of the whole essence of a quadratic approximation , where you start to have things like you get an x squared , and you get x gets to be multiplied by y , all of this stuff[/E2] stuff is the quadratic term
our multi variable function
we 're going to need them
this first part
's start taking second partial derivatives
yellow
the mixed partial derivative , where you do first with respect to x , then with respect to y , or you could do it the other way , because with almost all functions , it kind of does n't matter which order you take the two
This whole one half e to the x halves
like a constant , derivative of sin of y
that constant , the one half e to the x halves
the second derivative , second partial derivative with respect to y
derivative of cosin
This part is the only part where y shows up ,
negative sin
all of the partial differential information that we 're going to need
we know [E2]we[/E2] 're going to need to evaluate all of these guys , all of these partial derivatives at the specific point
that I made a little bit of a mistake here
a one half out in front of each of these guys
a mistake on my part
In any case
e to the zero
cosin of pi halves
negative one times
a convenient example , where all the derivatives look very similar to the thing itself , which is actually pretty common , so we get to leverage a lot of the work that we did earlier
these six different constants
that constant term
for the second partial derivative terms
I 'm realizing [E2]I[/E2] made the same mistake again
for that same reason
something we can simplify quite a bit
This mixed partial derivative term
this last term here
just negative one half
the quadratic approximation
up to x squared
for theoretical purposes
in the context of something called the second partial derivative test
the graph of the original function , e to the x halves times sin of y
the point we 're approximating near
a graph that looks like this white surface here
how we 're approximating the function near that point
the oscillating nature of that sin component
how this is a pretty useful theoretical tool for drawing conclusions about qualitative features of the shape of the graph , the fact that this looks kind of like a saddle , is going to end up being kind of important in certain contexts

The unit circle[/E2] circle definition of trig functions
this unit circle
sine of theta
as the x and y coordinates of this point at which this side of the angle , the side that is not the positive x - axis , where that intersects the unit circle
In the previous videos on the unit circle
about why this is really just a natural extension of the so cah toa definition
out of the fact that this point right over here is on a circle , a circle of radius one
the equation of a circle with radius one centered at the origin
other videos where we really prove this using the distance formula , which is really just an application of the Pythagorean theorem
that we 're defining cosine of theta as the x coordinate of this point and we 're defining sine of theta at the y coordinate of this point and this point is sitting on the circle
if we 're defining cosine of theta to be the x , to be this x value , sine of theta to be the y value and it has to satisfy this relationship
that means that cosine of theta squared plus sine squared of theta needs to be equal to one
just from the point
sine theta
This is the x
This is [E2]the x
cosine theta[/E2] theta is the x coordinate

Why is that useful
one of cosine of theta
out of where the equation of a circle even came from
the x coordinate is cosine theta[/E2] theta and the y coordinate is sine of theta[/E2] theta , what is the distance between that point and the origin
the x coordinate is cosine theta and the y coordinate is sine of theta , [E2]what[/E2] is the distance between that point and the origin
, we look at this point right over here , which we 're saying is [E2]the x coordinate is cosine theta
, we look at this point right over here , which we 're saying is the x coordinate is cosine theta

from the Pythagorean theorem
this is the same thing
why it 's called the Pythagorean identity
that 's even where the equation of a circle comes from
straight out of the Pythagorean theorem where your hypotenuse has length one
hey Sal , why do I even need to worry about this
a really valuable technique for solving quadratics
a pretty interesting technique
in this form
an X squared
an X squared here
two A is 16 or that A is equal to 8
an A squared over here , well if A is eight , I would add an eight squared which would be a 64
to an expression
without changing the value of an expression
all that [E2]I have done now
I have done now[/E2] now , is I just took our original expression
X squared plus two A X , where A is 8 , plus A squared , 64
because A is eight , A is eight , so this is X plus eight squared , and then all of this business on the right hand side
in this form ,
that symbol

we 're going to multiply this row
it to have the 4
for this next entry
for this entry over there
for this last entry

that might jump out at you[/E2] you is that all of these terms are divisible by x

two second - degree terms
instead of doing it that way
as a clue that maybe we can factor by grouping
these first two terms
What am [E2]I[/E2] talking about

I 'll leave these big green parentheses here for now

the whole point that I 'm factoring this
if I can find the product of a bunch of expressions equaling zero , then I can say , " Well , the product of those expressions " are going to be zero if one or more of those expressions " are equal to zero " , and I can solve for x

about vector fields in the context of two dimensions

for each one of those points
what the output of the function is
that vector

at every possible point , well not every possible point , but [E2]a sample of a whole bunch of points

So as y increases value to one , two , three , the length of these vectors are gon na increase

a really long vector
At a given point x , y , z

because of how we do vector fields
Like the vectors , these red guys that are out at the end
one of those vector fields that is actually pretty , a good one to have a strong intuition of 'cause it comes up now and then , thinking about what the identity function looks like as a vector field itself
through another example that 's a little bit more complicated than this and can hopefully give an even stronger feel for how the output can depend on x , y , and z.

about a relative maximum point
that are approaching the x value of our relative maximum point , as we approach it from values below that x value , we see that we have a positive slope
f is increasing , going into the relative maximum point , f is increasing , which means that the derivative of f the derivative of f must be greater than zero
that maximum point , after we past that maximum point , we see that our function needs to be decreasing
that our funciton is decreasing right over here , so
f decreasing , decreasing , which means that f prime of x needs to be less than zero
our relative maximum point
at an x value
at an x value where our first derivative transitions from being greater than zero
f prime transitioning from positive to negative
right here f prime is positive , positive , positive , and then it goes negative
, we see f prime is positive over here ,
that the function itself , not f prime , f must be increasing here because f prime is positive

Curl
one of those very cool vector calculus concepts

something that
of each particle , each one of these water molecules
as moving over time in such a way that the velocity vector of its movement at any given point in time is the vector that it 's attached to

at any given moment
along the vector that it 's attached to
at any given moment , if you look at the movement of one of these blue dots , [E2]it[/E2] 's moving along the vector that it 's attached to at that point
you to notice a couple of particular regions
to an idea that the vector field has a curl here
as being negative curl

x is[/E2] is going to be 15 times 2/5 , which is[/E2] is 15 divided by five is[/E2] is three , times two which is[/E2] is six

the rate of change of y with respect to x
for the sake of , I guess conceptually understanding it

the derivative of x with respect to t is
as functions of t
e to the 0.5 t
a bunch of things equaling zero
e to the 0.5 t is equal to two , cosine of t squared
cosine of t squared
Then I could subtract this from both sides , and I will get e to the 0.5 t minus two

the value of k for which f has a critical point at x equals negative five
that x , that means that x equals negative five is in domain , so this is in domain , which means our function itself is defined at x equals negative five , and it means that f prime of negative five is equal to zero or undefined
A critical point
a member of the functions domain where the derivative is equal to zero , or it 's undefined
what value of k
f prime of negative five equal to zero
a value of k for which f has a critical point at negative five
well , what values of k ?
a value of k that makes the derivative
well , why ca n't I pick a value of k that makes the derivative undefined
the important thing
in order to be a critical point , it has to be in the domain , and the derivative at that point has to be equal to zero undefined

about curl where if we have a two dimensional vector field V defined with component functions P and Q , I 've said that the 2D curl of that function V gives you a new function that also takes in x and y
And my hope is that this is more than just a formula and that you can understand how this represents fluid rotation in two dimensions but what I want to do here is show how the original intuition I gave for this formula might be a little oversimplified because for example , if we look at this , the partial Q , partial x component , I said that you can imagine that Q at some point starting off a little bit negative

to do here is show how the original intuition I gave for this formula might be a little oversimplified because for example , if we look at this , the partial Q , partial x component , I said that you can imagine that Q at some point starting off a little bit negative so the y component of the output is a little negative , then as you move positively in the x direction , [E2]it[/E2] goes to being zero

in terms of the formula
this term
as being significant and various other formulas and circumstances
in trying to understand this formula
that you can give a fluid flow interpretation that gives a very deep understanding of what 's going on beyond just the symbols themselves
a relatively straightforward formula
partial Q with respect to x
the fact that this is constant
the fact [E2]that this is constant
that this is constant[/E2] constant , tells us that when we look over at this fluid flow , the sense in which curl , the formula for curl wants to say that rotation happens around the center is just as strong as it 's supposed to happen over here on the right , or anywhere on the plane for that matter
that this is constant , tells [E2]us[/E2] that when we look over at this fluid flow , the sense in which curl , the formula for curl wants to say that rotation happens around the center is just as strong as it 's supposed to happen over here on the right , or anywhere on the plane for that matter
So if we 're playing this and if you imagine you have the paddle wheel in the center , evidently it would be rotating just as quickly as the paddle on the right even though it might
it 's important to understand what else two dimensional curl can look like and what else this formula might be representing

how do you compute this curl value that I 've been talking about
this to be vector - valued
something that equals a vector output
a three - dimensional point
nabla , that upside - down triangle we used in divergence and gradient
As a reminder
the kind of thing where , when you say it out loud , it sounds kinda fancy , a vector full of partial differential operators , but all it really means is I 'm just going to write a bunch of symbols
This partial partial x
something that wants to take in a multi - variable function , and tell you its partial derivative
this does n't really make [E2]sense[/E2] , like , hey , how can a vector contain these partial differential operators
P and Q
just functions of x and y
P and y
So I 'm kind of overloading notation right , over here I have a two - dimensional vector field that I 'm saying
scale or value functions with a two - dimensional input
as separate
as taking these diagonal components and multiplying them , so that would be your partial partial x
Then you subtract off [E2]this[/E2] diagonal component here
Then you subtract off this diagonal component here
a y
partial partial y
partial partial y of P
something you recognize
the two - dimensional curl
It 's something we got an intuition for
it to be more than just a formula
The way [E2]you compute a thing like this
you compute a thing like this[/E2] this , is you construct a determinant
The top row of that
all of the unit vectors in various directions of three - dimensional space
the unit vector in the x direction
J and K
the unit vectors in the y and z direction
in the top rows
as vectors
the trick to computing the cross - product
For the last row
For [E2]the last row
the last row , [E2]you[/E2] put in the second vector , which is in this case , is vector value function P , Q , and R
the last row[/E2] row , you put in the second vector , which is in this case , is vector value function P , Q , and R
kind of an absurd thing
all of the components
a notational trick
like this absurd , convoluted , as far away from a matrix full of numbers thing as you can get
through the process of computing this determinant and saying , what could that mean , the thing that pops out is going to be the formula for three - dimensional curl
At the risk of having a video that runs too long
the graph of f
on what open intervals contained in negative three is less than x is less than four
how we can tell when f is concave down
do I need to observe of f prime because that 's the graph they gave us

of the places where we are negative
the subset of where we are negative
we are also decreasing

A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning
the dramatic monologue

If I really read it actually with the comma , it would have been " A poetic form congenial " to Robert Browning was the dramatic monologue

more pause
about , instead of a comma here , you could put a period there , kind of a full stop
a related thought
at least a semi
colon
that we do n't really like that one
the dramatic monologe , which let him explore a character 's mind without the simplifications demanded by stage productions
this relative pronoun " which " ,
with a comma
the need to put a period or a semi - colon
this is actually a pretty good

a pretty good , this is actually a pretty good solution
a pretty good[/E2] good , this is actually a pretty good[/E2] good solution
the dramatic monologue that lets him explore a character 's mind without the simplifications demanded by stage productions
when they 're using " that " here , it feels much more like they 're telling us a certain type of dramatic monologue
that that 's the only type of dramatic monologue
all dramatic monologues let him explore a character 's mind without the simplifications demanded by stage productions
That 's what a dramatic monologue is
someone talking without other stuff
the meaning of it
It does n't
the meaning
it feels like it 's qualifying the type of dramatic monologue
the intention of the sentence
, that the reason why it was , that dramatic monologues are good for Robert Browning , are that all dramatic monologues let him explore a character 's mind without the simplifications demanded by stage productions
kind of , a weak scratch out
it 's just kind of changing the meaning
the dramatic monologue , semi - colon , letting him explore a character 's mind without the simplifications demanded by stage productions
the semi
colon that I kind of wanted in the beginning
, but then they 're making this into , it 's not no longer , the second , what we have after that is no longer kind of an independent phrase like it was , or an independent almost clause , like it was before

Phototropism in plants
a response in which a plant shoot grows toward a light source
these first three treatment groups
pretty good evidence that there is there is something about the tip of the plant that allows the phototropism to occur , it allows the plant to know which direction
no bending occurred
No bending occurred
something about the tip
So that 's all there is to it , it only occurred when there was an unaltered tip[/E2] tip , so that was treatment one that has access to light

three different , if interrelated subjects
the writer
these are three different subjects , but they 're giving a little bone to the idea
that they are interrelated
different subjects
how it reads there
three different , if interrelated , subjects
three interrelated subjects being however different
The real point of it
that they 're trying to say that they 're different subjects ,
although I 'm willing to admit that they are , they 're not completely unrelated
although I 'm willing to admit that they are ,[/E2] , they 're not completely unrelated
that they 're interrelated subjects
a different meaning
they put all these commas in there and it 's kind of hard to read and really long
three different subjects
the point that they 're three different subjects
because of that convoluted phrasing and using of whereas
as good as the first choice
that the completely incorrect meaning
three subjects that are different although being interrelated
three subjects that are different

about an equilateral triangle
each one of those p and q
two different variables
as it 's input
the same inputs that the vector field does
of thinking of this
as a differential thing
in the same way that you have , you know , a derivative
a function
that I have here , [E2]we[/E2] want , that at a point like this , where there 's a lot of counter - clockwise rotation happening around it , for the curl function to return a positive number
at a point like this , where there 's some , where there 's clockwise rotation happening around it
the curl to return a negative number
Above it

a vector pointing straight to the left
perfect curl
in our kind of
positive example
these bottom guys
, if you start thinking about what this means for ,
the , the very specific , almost contrived scenario that I 'm looking at
that the partial derivative of p
, that the partial derivative of p , with respect to y , so as we change that y component , moving up in the plane , and look at the x component of the vectors , that should be negative
, [E2]that the partial derivative of p[/E2] p , with respect to y , so as we change that y component , moving up in the plane , and look at the x component of the vectors , that should be negative
in circumstances where we want positive curl
at cases , you know the quintessential case where curl is positive
that a partial derivative of q , with respect to x , should be positive
these guys
all you need to know
as a formula
that the 2d curl , 2d curl , of our vector field v , as a function of x
the formula for two - dimensional curl
each of the vectors was turned around and you have clockwise rotation , each of these values
the opposite of this , if [E2]each of the vectors was turned around and you have clockwise rotation , each of these values[/E2] values will become the negative of what it had been before
some examples of what it looks like to use this formula
Many economists
that since resources are scarce and since human desires can not all be blank , a method of blank is needed
an infinite amount of resources
all human desires
everybody
so many resources
some way to split those resources , to apportion those resources amongst people
distribution
for the second one , but verifying human desires
a much better choice
about verifying , making sure that we know the actual human desires and then distributing based on it
I would rule [E2]this one right over here
you 're kind of ignoring them and removing them and putting in place different desires somehow
from someone
about trying to usurp folks
not all human desires can be expressed ,

the thermodynamic data for [E2]the reaction
the thermodynamic data for [E2]the reaction[/E2] reaction support the students claim
that since the reaction
their claim
Delta G
to equilibrium constants
The good thing
that they give you all of the formulas that you need
on the first page of the free response section
this formula
the change in enthalpy for the reaction
the temperature , 298 Kelvin
the change in entropy for the reaction
the change in standard entropy , change in standard enthalpy for the reaction
Delta G is going to be
OK , is it consistent ?
Is it greater than zero ? Which is conssistant with the reaction not being spontaneous which seems to be what 's observed
Is it greater than zero ?[/E2] ? Which is conssistant with the reaction not being spontaneous which seems to be what 's observed
from that Delta G
to the equilibrium constant
Delta G in the equilibrium constant
some things about R and T
exactly what R and T are if we need them
our change in standard enthalpy
what the temperature is
that that is 298 Kelvin
about R
in a second
our change in standard enthalpy and our change in standard entropy at 298 Kelvin
our change in enthalpy
45.5 kilojoules per mole
Our change in standard entropy
126 joules per Kelvin - mole
This is given in kilojoules
This is given [E2]in kilojoules
in kilojoules , [E2]this[/E2] is given in joules
in kilojoules[/E2] kilojoules , this is given in joules
sure that we 're being consistent
this is[/E2] is , [E2]this right over here
this is , this right over here
this is
45,500 joules per mole
the Delta G is going to be
the difference
126
three significant figures
7,900
7,950
7,900 , roughly 7,950
the fact that this is greater than zero
the fact [E2]that this is greater than zero
that this is greater than zero[/E2] zero tells us that this is not going to be spontaneous at that temperature
that this is greater than zero tells [E2]us[/E2] that this is not going to be spontaneous at that temperature
a good reality check
Delta
In the videos on Khan Academy on Gibbs free energy
into a lot more detail on what this is
this is the energy , the change in energy that 's available to do work
the course of the reaction , [E2]that[/E2] means the products have more energy to do work
you have to put work into it in order for the reaction to actually proceed
your Delta G is negative [E2]that[/E2] means your products have less energy to do work than your reactants
that it can release that energy
the formula that ties our Delta G to our equilibrium constant
the other things
R
we 'll validate that it 's going to be less than one
for the equilibrium constant
the natural log of my equilibrium constant
I 'll just write it this way
E , this is just
What power do [E2]I[/E2] raise E to
What power do I raise [E2]E[/E2] to
E to the negative 7,950 joules per mole over RT is going t to be equal to K
what this is
with joules and moles
This is positive
that is positive
it 's 298 kelvin positive
that K equals E to negative number
this right
less than one
careful , not less than zero
to less than zero
this by itself
the students claim
K is equal to E to the negative 7,950 joules per mole over R
your number
this is going to be dimensionless
eight point three one four times 298
to that power
approximately zero
you could say , well let 's just say four
approximately zero point four

another way that [E2]you could have tried to do it

X , I get X times X minus six
the numerator and denomenator of this first time
by X minus six
by the denominator of the other one
let 's see if I distribute the A , it would give us A X minus six
I 'm just going back to this
A X plus B X must be equal to zero
well that means A plus B is equal to zero
of that term
that this must be the constant term that adds up to one
that negative six A is equal to one

p and n
integers such that p is greater than n[/E2] n , is greater than zero
since p is strictly greater than n that means that they 're two different integers
the following[/E2] following can be the value of p minus , the value of p minus n
as p plus n
a difference of two positive integers
positive integers
The reason why we know p minus n[/E2] n is a positive integer
they tell us that p is greater than n
12 times one
six times two which is equal to 12
four times three which is also equal to 12
all of the contenders for p plus n
for p
the left hand side
with two p
the right hand side
13 ,
You divide both sides by two
p is equal to 13 over two
an integer
p plus n
p minus n
the larger of the two factors
p is equal to four
They 're different positive integers
that p minus n is equal to two
a possible value of p minus n
p plus n is equal to four
Just like here
If [E2]p[/E2] plus n was four and p minus n is three then you are not going to have
a possibility
even without doing that exercise
to three but not to four
that they are n't

the intuitive explanation for it
the tension there is T1[/E2] T1 , the tension over here
Now [E2]the tension there is T1
that the whole system is going to accelerate , is going to accelerate on the right
trouble drawing straight lines
all of the forces that are relevant to the magnitude of the acceleration
its weight , which we could call m3
with block 1
m1
Here we 're accelerating to the right , here we 're accelerating up , here we 're accelerating down , but the magnitudes are going to be the same
with this lower - case a
about block 3
that the net forces , well that 's m2 g minus T2 , that 's going against m2 g , is equal to m2 times its acceleration
the a
that all
in the chat in a second
with Kristin , with me , and with your fellow educators across the country
Kristin
some questions
Jeremy 's thanks to you for taking some time out of your busy schedule to chat with us today
that you find the things that I have to share helpful
the little story of what I have recently decided to learn
the instructions , like fold here
how it all comes together in the end to make a bird or a frog
All right , here 's the thing that I want to learn
like a good , applicable skill
a good one
an interesting reaction from my mom
Oh , I would never try to learn origami
over lots and lots of motivation research
over lots and lots of [E2]motivation[/E2] research
motivation
into some pretty simple equations
that motivation
whether you expect you can be successful at something and how much you value the task
in education research jargon
that we like to do things when we think we 're going to be successful at them
just about these two simple things
students expect that they will be able to do this ? That if they try this , they can be successful at it
, [E2]you know what , it turns out , nothing
you know what , it turns out , nothing[/E2] nothing makes you feel like you 'll be successful in the future like having been successful in the past
a good way to really mark whether you 're successful
by meeting a goal
in the setting goals together
if the student has some input into what the goal is , that actually increases the value of the task
their buy - in to the task
success and value
in that motivation equation piece of things
even for adults , longterm goals are pretty difficult to keep at , to maintain all of that work towards them
even for our high schoolers
a specific goal , probably not to be longer than a week in terms of what they 're going to do
my goal in the origami is to be able to make one of those frogs that you can hit the back of and it jumps
if I get there
that 's what I 'm
that 's what [E2]I 'm
I 'm , that 's what I 'm currently working on for this week 's goal
I 'm[/E2] 'm , that 's what I 'm[/E2] 'm currently working on for this week 's goal
questions like what helped you get there ?
the second piece
The third piece
about working collaboratively
we can work together on something , we can work and each contribute something and feeling like I 'm contributing to a piece of this
the value of a task
in a lot of motivation language , it 's tempting to think about things like leaderboards and we can create a leaderboard
research tells us that those competitive kinds of situations are n't great for the kids who are often at the lower end of the achievements spectrum
a lot more to kind of crush students ' spirit
the value of the task
a big piece
about thinking whether you can be successful or not
connections
That 's thinking faster
your brain getting smarter
your brain muscle getting swole , kid
to yourself
I ca n't do this
your brain , the stronger and more powerful your thinking parts
a big piece that we can think about , again , not just kind of praising effort , but helping students to understand how it really does lead to them understanding and being able to do more things
step four
about kind of peer relationships
the other thing that is really important
your relationships with students
a couple of things we can do
one is definitely think about how you are coming to know your students as people , like , what are their , what are they interested in
that relationship building
both in terms of , you know , just having good relationships with your students , but also in terms of motivation
that this idea that Julia posted about being your genuine self , and that is part of relationship building is sharing a little bit of yourself too , being your quirky self , or sharing a little bit that 's different
number five , build relationships
this is like the , one of the top 10 most hated questions
that yes , you 're going to use this specific Pythagorean theorem in our future , in your life , but think broadly about what student 's goals are and think about how the things you 're learning relate to maybe it 's outside interests , maybe it 's career goals , maybe it 's just related to something else they want to learn how to do
Any way [E2]that you can make the things that they 're learning relevant to the real world
Any way that you can make the things that they 're learning relevant [E2]to the real world
that you can make the things that they 're learning relevant to the real world[/E2] world and applicable in the real world[/E2] world increases that value of the task
that you can make the things that they 're learning relevant [E2]to the real world and applicable in the real world increases that value of the task
to the real world[/E2] world and applicable in the real world[/E2] world increases that value of the task to students
to the real world and applicable in the real world increases that value of the task[/E2] task to students
an important piece
number six
Lots of folks
with , you know , with all kinds of exercise , apps
All those things
for a reason
The key
there 's a couple things in terms of the research about how to use rewards wisely
the first
you want to be careful because students that are already doing something because it 's really interesting to them
if you have students that , you know , are n't that interested , internal rewards can be a good way to get someone started
external rewards
a good way to get someone started on something so that then they can experience that feeling of success
all of those things that then kind of move them towards more internal rewards
little things
not big things ,
the chat
a great conversation
in the chat room
those links
in the , go to webinar control panel
with a question from Sage
a piece of it is it 's that they do n't , you know , like how they look , is it they do n't like the background
It 's probably
that it 's probably not great to do a lot of commenting on people 's videos and backgrounds ,
that it 's probably[/E2] probably not great to do a lot of commenting on people 's videos and backgrounds ,
like spot - on advice
Sage
that 's super relevant in their district
that extra oomph of motivation
a little pre
planning
I know for those of us that are on Zoom lots during the day , I 'm on Zoom calls , you know , all the time
that , you know , let 's all take a break
a couple of those stretches
the 20 - 20 - 20 rule
a little piece of section of cards that we call refresh
the refresh cards
simple little questions that you can have students do
questions like if 2020 were a food , what would it be ?
that same question
it looked like haggis
like spoiled potato salad
Another quick question
from Denise
Denise
" One of the hardest things " with distance learning is collaboration
for building connections " and also accelerating learning
" How do we do that in [E2]this[/E2] environment ? "
Denise saying her school does n't allow unsupervised Google Meet
things a lot more difficult
the ideal answer
lots of software ,
breakout rooms
as the teacher
to the different rooms
at various times
kind of an ideal situation

a really interesting question which is , " Kristin , do you have any really practical how - to tools " to help kids set goals " and then monitor those on a weekly basis ?
off the ground
in that first setting
some goals
what do
a really simple template
the best thing that I 've seen
we 're at the bottom of the hour
a super good demonstration of learning through collaboration
the magnitude of velocity
the x , actually let me draw it [E2]this[/E2] way , if you have the x dimension of , or the x component of a velocity , right over there , so this is the rate of , which x is changing with respect to time
dy dt
the magnitude of that
This right here
the speed
e to the zero point five t
our expression for speed , as a function of time
And now we can subtract nine from both sides , and we get cosine of t squared , squared , [E2]I[/E2] could 've written cosine squared of t squared , but this makes it a little bit clearer
e to the , but my variable that I 'm gon na solve for[/E2] for is x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x just for[/E2] for inputting into the calculator , e to the x minus nine
e to the , but my variable that I 'm gon na solve for [E2]is x[/E2] x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x[/E2] x just for inputting into the calculator , e to the x[/E2] x minus nine
e to the , but my variable that [E2]I 'm gon na solve for is x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x just for inputting into the calculator[/E2] calculator , e to the x minus nine
So second [E2]e to the , but my variable that I 'm gon na solve for
So second e to the , but my variable that I 'm gon na solve for
So second e to the , but my variable that [E2]I 'm gon na solve for
is x
I 'm gon na solve for is x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x just for inputting into the calculator
I 'm gon na solve for[/E2] for is x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x just for[/E2] for inputting into the calculator
I 'm gon na solve for [E2]is x[/E2] x , I 'm just replacing all the t 's with x[/E2] x just for inputting into the calculator

Nightjars
a camouflage perhaps unparalleled in the bird world
nightjars are birds
By day
that these nightjars , which are birds , they have a camouflage unparalleled in the bird world
what camouflage means
at the choices
the types of words that I would try to look for for these blanks
a lot of sense , that the birds would be that way regarding their surroundings
that means [E2]that[/E2] they 're kind of so stuck into their surroundings that you ca n't even pull them out , if you wanted to
like the choice that I would go
like the best choice
harmonize
a horrible word
in sync with something
Distinguish
a bad word
for the second blank
That kind
the same type of meaning as discern or pick out or see , relative to its background
kind of like being mixed or blended
a label
You 're not only discerning it
for choice E
kind of a not horrible choice
Region S
the base of a solid whose cross sections perpendicular to the x - axis are squares
In the last part
that this function is f , and this function is g
some values
more of a kind of an upward trend , especially as x increases
about 'em
in different ways like that
We know that the upper bound of region S , x is equal to
We know that the upper bound of region S , [E2]x is equal to
x is equal to , [E2]we[/E2] know x is equal to two here
x is equal to[/E2] to , we know x is equal to[/E2] to two here
what this x value is
that at that x value , the functions are going to be equal to each other
that f of a
in the last section
about the absolute value of f of x minus g of x , which we 've already inputed into our calculator and saved it
that the absolute value of f of a minus g of a is equal to zero
the absolute value there
into our calculator
that thing we inputed into our calculator
In our calculator
the absolute value of f of x

the concentration of potassium sorbate , [E2]we[/E2] put the brackets
the concentration of potassium sorbate , we put the brackets
in the stock solution
The equivalence point
the point[/E2] point at which all of the potassium sorbate has reacted with the acid , with the titrate
to the right - hand side of this net ionic equation
it is , it[/E2] it 's the point in which , because we are reacting , for every mole of the potassium sorbate that we want to turn into sorbic acid
one way to think about the equivalence point
if I 've added a certain number of moles of hydrochloric acid , that must the exact number of moles of the potassium sorbate that we started out with
the exact number of molecules of hydrochloric acid as they originally were of potassium sorbate
Well , the equivalence point "
the total amount of hydrochloric acid solution we 've added in liters

1/3 of the American population
In 1900
in cities
the beginning of a new modern era
the pay and the standard of living
for both immigrants and Southern African Americans
an improvement on their previous circumstances
The transition to life in the modern industrial city
new opportunities for women
These kinds of clerical jobs
to minority women whose options for work outside the home were limited to domestic service or agricultural labor
The mass production techniques of the 1920s
that the price of consumer goods dropped so that average people could afford to buy appliances and even cars
enough disposable income to go to the theater or to an amusement park or to a speakeasy illegally selling alcohol
These fears
to the passage of new immigration restrictions in the 1920s
This act
quotas of immigrants who could arrive from each nation
The law
the immigration of Mexicans whom western farmers relied upon for seasonal labor
AB , the length of this segment
In triangle ABC above
the midpoint of AB
E is the midpoint of AB
the mid point of AC
that AC is the same length as AB so AD is going to be the same length as that
the length of BC
that they are similar
AD
the corresponding side on the larger triangle , on triangle ABC
the ratio between corresponding sides of ABC and AED
the ratio

the length of segment BC
maybe the triangle looks like this
that this is necessarily a right triangle
a little bit like one
what would that look like
something really interesting
a dilation centered at point B with a scale factor of 0.5
BC was dilated down to is half the length of the original BC
half the length of the original AB
at other heights along this pyramid
the cross section
like a dilation of our original triangle centered at point B
like a dilation centered at point B with a scale factor of 0.25
a way to conceptualize dilations , or see the relationship between cross sections of a three - dimensional shape , in this case like a pyramid
a point
an actual triangle
as a dilation with a scale factor of one
some dots for you between cross sections of a three - dimensional shape that is parallel to the base and notions of dilation
some dots [E2]for you[/E2] you between cross sections of a three - dimensional shape that is parallel to the base and notions of dilation
that it would last very long
Some founded as religious refuges , some
joint stock companies
This benign neglect of the American colonies
the same books
One thing that they shared
a political culture
the colonies
their own local representative governments
to a tradition of self - rule and self - taxation
this tended to divide the colonies from England
warfare against a common enemy
For the colonists
their sense that they belonged to the British Empire
these conflicts
a source of unity and division between the colonists and the British Government
A big area of cultural exchange
in religion
the destination of choice for religious dissenters
The established Church of England
in the colonies
religion in general
together with the mother country
religion
as something that both united and divided the colonies from Great Britain
Another shared cultural experience
the Enlightenment , which spread ideas about reason and self - government through books and pamphlets that were read all over the Atlantic world
the shared ideas of [E2]the Enlightenment
the shared ideas of the Enlightenment
the shared ideas of [E2]the Enlightenment[/E2] Enlightenment brought the Empire
the shared ideas of the Enlightenment brought the Empire
at least at this point
Another aspect of cultural exchange
fashion and consumer goods
The elite American colonists
like the English gentry
these cultural exchanges
a force uniting the colonies with the mother country
Caribbean
British investors and the owners of slave ships and plantations [E2]in the Caribbean
in the Caribbean[/E2] Caribbean were deeply involved in the system of slavery
Atlantic
Another central aspect of the British Empire 's economy
mercantilism , an economic philosophy that championed using colonies as sources of raw materials and as markets for finished goods
that mercantilism both united and divided the colonies from the Empire
the British Government
In terms of social and cultural exchanges
this tool
a slope of one
We go from one point of the line to the other , [E2]you[/E2] have to go one to the right , and one up
it has a slope of one , and the y intercept is going to be the point x equals zero , y equals two
that we now go through that point
The things , the point , like point S right over here that was [E2]to the top and left of the line[/E2] line , its reflection , the corresponding point in the image
to the top and left of the line
The things that were to the right and the bottom of our line[/E2] line , like point P , it 's the corresponding point in the reflection
on the other side of the line
So there you go
we 're done , and we got it right
themes
big ideas about the world we live in
with the action of a text
the Rings " stories and films , the One Ring
the Rings " stories and films[/E2] films , the One Ring
in " The Lord of [E2]the Rings " stories and films
in " The Lord of the Rings " stories and films
absolute power and how dangerous that is
Tolkien
as an author
that theme
the Ring
over me
a power " still greater and more deadly
how the plot is shaped around this object and how a group of people come together to identify this Ring as a dangerous , magical artifact that needs to be destroyed for the good of the world
just dialogue
descriptions by the author and actions taken by the characters
one of the great pleasures of rereading
one way to develop theme
through the repeated use of a symbol or an object
The Ring in "
a great example
anything , a design , an object , an animal
And throughout this story ,
a best friend named Robin
the idea of flight is a theme in this story , and
the idea of flight[/E2] flight is a theme in this story , and
all of these bird - related things go back to this character 's desire to take flight
Changes in setting
a fine way to develop themes
at a tense portion in the story
to a distant mountaintop
the weather
what 's [E2]the weather[/E2] weather like
about , he might think about it
this presented as explicit lessons by a sage character , usually older and wise
Moana
Yoda
Luke
something explicit like , " Go do the thing your heart wants , Moana , " or , " Trust that the energy of the universe " will make you a really good space wizard , Luke
words so powerful that they become magic
just another way to say theme
Some of the most powerful moments in storytelling
from action , not just dialogue
Some of these themes
without speaking a single word
that all of them share the same theme , which is you can learn anything
in this last video
The Second Great Awakening
both the idea that one should try to create heaven on earth and also , a more democratic approach to religion in general , that it did n't matter who you were
to a personal relationship with God and a chance at salvation
one of the things this meant in this time period
that there 's just a lot of religious experimentation
A lot of new American religions emerge [E2]at this time period[/E2] period , some of which are still with us today , some of which are not
at this time period
This here
a representation of the Shakers , which were a religious community of , they embrace kind of simplicity
the sexes
celibacy
their ecstasy
in this process of these big circle dances , which people looked at and they said they seemed like they were shaking
that approaches to sex were very central to these religious movements
Oneida
one other interesting thing about this
the Oneida community
So the last and probably the most important part of The Second Great Awakening that I wanna talk about
its influence on reform movements
People who were really motivated by their faith in God and their faith in trying to create heaven on earth and a better society
for the end of slavery
a really complex topic , The Second Great Awakening
that people got really interested in religion in this time period
at this , this parametric function for a three dimensional curve
of the circle that most closely hugs that curve
at the helix over here
this tangent vector function
at every given value , T , whatever point that corresponds to on the curve
the ultimate goal
for curvature
it 's magnitude
by dividing out , by the derivative of the parameterization function , with respect to T
arclength , this magnitude of the derivative of the parameterization with respect to T
a hard word
given that we have this kind of fractions and fractions form , I 'm just going to start by writing it a little bit more simply
that five
into the numerator , divided by the root of 26
that d big T , d little t , so tangent vector function parameter , is equal to
negative five sine
to negative five cosine
by the constant , square root of 26
five cosine
to negative five sine
the last component
just a constant
this magnitude
the square root of , make the little tic there , square root of the sum of the squares of these guys
25 times sine squared , sine squared of t , also divided by 26
inside that radical
inside that[/E2] that radical
for a curvature equation
that numerator
the magnitude of the derivative itself
one of the things we needed to do to find the tangent vector
this 26 over five came from
from where we did last video
the root of that whole thing
25 over 26
That right there
the curvature
by kind of pulling that spring and pulling it so that there 's a z component
by kind of pulling that spring and pulling [E2]it so that there 's a z component
it so that there 's a z component , [E2]you[/E2] 're making it a little bit more straight
it so that there 's a z component[/E2] component , you 're making it a little bit more straight
the curvature of a helix
in the next example
I think [E2]I[/E2] 'll go through one where you just use the formula
I think I 'll go through one where you just use the formula
something a little bit more complicated than thinking about this
a function here defined as x squared minus 5x plus 6
what form would we put this in
that we have a positive coefficient on the x squared term
the minimum point of this
this point right over here for this function
the roots[/E2] roots , the easiest thing I can think of doing
in order to find [E2]the roots
about , well , let 's think of two numbers whose product is positive 6 and whose sum is negative 5
that they have the same sign
they have the same sign but we get to a negative
Negative 2 plus [E2]negative 3
negative 3[/E2] 3 is negative 5
as being equal to x minus 2 times x minus 3
as being equal to x[/E2] x minus 2 times x[/E2] x minus 3
us find the zeroes
0 , [E2]0[/E2] times anything
0 times anything else
x is equal to 2 or x is equal to 3
those are the two zeroes for this function
in terms of graphing it
x equals 1
x equals 2
x equals 3
our x
our y is equal to f of x axis
that we intersect both here
either of these values
into the original expression
it 's going to get you to 0
f of x is equal to x squared minus 5x
some real estate
the value of this right - hand side
the general idea
this is going to be a perfect square if we take this coefficient right over here
5/2
1/2 of that , which is negative 5/2
as plus negative-- what 's negative 5/2 squared
2 squared
from that side
the total value on that side
25/4
into more detail about why taking 1/2 the coefficient here and then squaring it , adding it there and then subtracting there , why that works
in the completing the square videos
that they are equivalent
that 's [E2]that[/E2] part
as 24/4
24/4
24/4 minus 25/4 is [E2]negative 1/4[/E2] 1/4 , so minus 1/4[/E2] 1/4 , just like that
negative 1/4
our original function
At the minimum value
positive values
its minimum value-- well , [E2]it[/E2] hits its minimum value
its minimum value
with negative 1/4
our vertex is at the point x equals 5/2 , y equals negative 1/4
the same thing as 2 and 1/2
1 , 1/4
that right over there
the vertex
That is the point-- let me make it clear--
That is [E2]the point-- let me make it clear--
the point-- let me make it clear-- [E2]that[/E2] 's the point
the point-- let me make it clear--[/E2] clear-- that 's the point
the point-- let me make it clear-- that 's the point
5/2 comma negative 1/4
the roots
as two other points
just as an example
to our old friend sodium chloride
an oxygen attached to two hydrogens
this hydrogen bond forming , where the partially negative end of one water molecule
hydrogen bonds are all about
whole videos on that
that 's the chloride anion
a sodium cation
The reason why this dissolves well
that the negative charge is able to be drawn to the positive end
the positive sodium cation
to the negative end of the water molecules
those weak forces , kind of attracting them to each other
is going to happen if I try to put , say , some hexane , if I view that as a solute , and I were to put it in water
One example
ethanol , which has an OH group
that partially negative charge
that polarity to the molecule
our mega takeaway here
that like

the Brown case , [E2]I[/E2] sought out the help of two experts

but for reasons not related to " separate but equal " , or segregation
Court
the opinion
A portion of the opinion
it sound as though this is a kind of social science conclusion , that segregation breeds a feeling of inferiority that has a deleterious effect on the black students ' performance in school
that the only reason to have laws requiring black and white to be separate was because of the feeling on the part of the dominant white group that the African race was inferior
it was a failure of political will , really , rather than a matter of constitutional or legal logic that
on its face
with respect to segregation and Jim Crow across the board

in this Topeka case
that the schools were , in fact , equal , in all respects
of course they were n't
that these schools
this place where they 're hoping not to have a ruling that , for example , oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code to be the same as white children , but
this place where [E2]they 're hoping not to have a ruling that , for example , oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code to be the same as white children , but
they 're hoping not to have a ruling that , for example , oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code to be the same as white children , but they 're trying to strike down the idea of segregation altogether
they 're hoping not to have a ruling that , for example , oh the schools for black children need to be brought up to code to be the same as white children , but[/E2] but they 're trying to strike down the idea of segregation altogether
that separate but equal facilities are inherently unequal
the Cold War period
upon what social scientists might think about how people do in school
a much more fundamental principle of equality under the law , that our law must treat black and white the same
Latinos
Hispanics
that does n't mean [E2]that[/E2] Brown was n't significant
in the year of Brown v
The America that I grew up in
a very different country than the one that preceded it
Board of Education , no civil rights movement
to a great degree
no Barack Obama
Brown stands , as I said , as a dividing point in America , but we can do better
Board of Education
a major blow to the system of segregation
Two of [E2]the most studied operons
the most studied operons[/E2] operons are the Trp operon
about E
an operon that is on the E
just as a reminder , an operon is a combination of a set of genes
in particular [E2]you[/E2] have the promoter
in particular you have the promoter
the regulatory DNA sequences for that set of genes , in particular [E2]you[/E2] have the promoter , you have the operator
the regulatory DNA sequences for that set of genes[/E2] genes , in particular you have the promoter , you have the operator
the regulatory DNA sequences for that set of genes , [E2]in particular you have the promoter[/E2] promoter , you have the operator
The operator
where the repressor binds
these genes
so what are [E2]these genes[/E2] genes actually code for
the enzymes involved
of amino acids
in that world
in [E2]that world
that world , [E2]it[/E2] makes sense that in a low tryptophan environment , the RNA polymerase can just latch on to the promoter and begin the transcription process , transcribe these five genes into mRNA which then can be translated into those enzymes and they you will have more tryptophan biosynthesis
that world[/E2] world , it makes sense that in a low tryptophan environment , the RNA polymerase can just latch on to the promoter and begin the transcription process , transcribe these five genes into mRNA which then can be translated into those enzymes and they you will have more tryptophan biosynthesis
that world , it makes [E2]sense[/E2] that in a low tryptophan environment , the RNA polymerase can just latch on to the promoter and begin the transcription process , transcribe these five genes into mRNA which then can be translated into those enzymes and they you will have more tryptophan biosynthesis
a lot of tryptophan
that maybe tryptophan can act as a co - repressor for a repressor molecule , for a repressor enzyme , that would attach to the operator and block the RNA polymerase from transcribing
if you 're in a high tryptophan environment , and tryptophan obviously does not look
when you have a lot of tryptophan , the tryptophan can act as a co - repressor
to the Trp repressor
tryptophan
an interesting thing
the classic feedback inhibition
about operons and gene regulation
the ones that are most typically talked about
we just talked about[/E2] about here , where you have your tryptophan act as a co - repressor of the Trp repressor , and also the feedback inhibition , which once again , it 's not really about[/E2] about gene regulation , but you can see how the product of this process can go back and inhibit one of the first enzymes
a number line
about this--
about all the numbers from negative three to two
in order to be more precise
negative three and two
how I can depict it on a number line , by actually filling in the endpoints
that this is all of the
these are all of the x 's that are between negative three and two
x is less than or equal to positive two
Another way that [E2]we could depict this closed interval
Another way that we could depict this closed interval
we could depict this closed interval[/E2] interval is we could say , okay , we 're talking about the interval[/E2] interval between , and
once again I 'm using brackets here , these brackets tell us that we include , this bracket on the left says that we include negative three , and this bracket on the right says that we include positive two in our interval
once again I 'm using brackets here , these brackets tell us that we include , this bracket on the left says that we include negative three , and[/E2] and this bracket on the right says that we include positive two in our interval
things written a little bit more math - y
x is a member of the real numbers such that
these curly brackets
These curly brackets
that we 're talking about a set of values , and we 're saying that the set of all x 's that are a member of the real number , so this is just fancy math notation , it 's a member of the real numbers
the Greek letter epsilon
a member of the real numbers
This vertical line here
such that , " negative three is less x is less than-- negative three is less than or equal to x , is less than or equal to two
different ways of denoting or depicting the same interval
the closed circles
Over here had closed circles
that I included negative three and two
open circles
the notation for this
one way to say it
the interval
from negative one to four
These brackets
" Hey , let me include the endpoint
that we 're dealing with an open interval
an open interval
okay , in this case both endpoints were included , it 's a closed interval
In this case both endpoints were excluded
things that have one endpoint included and one point excluded
an example of that
another number line
Negative four
less than , not less than or equal to
everything in between
x is a member of the real numbers such that x is a member of the interval , so it 's going to go between negative four and negative one
an open circle
a bracket
on that side
That right over there
the notation
well hey , everything except for some values
x can be a member of the real numbers but x can not be equal to one
anything else
x is a member of the real numbers such that x is less than one
something interesting
This is the one that I would use
This is [E2]the one that I would use
the one that I would use , [E2]this[/E2] is the shortest
the one that I would use[/E2] use , this is the shortest
hey , everything except for one
something fancy
a parentheses
the view there
you could never include everything all the way up to infinity
It 's not really an endpoint
the notation for open interval
at least at that end
the simplest notation to describe that
The dimensions of the Earth and moon
in relationship to each other
the golden ratio
chills
even more chills
that phi plus 1 is phi squared , which is neat by itself
phi
1.61803
approximately 1.61803
2.61803
just another way of expressing this
by applying the Pythagorean equation to this equation , a right triangle with sides phi square root of phi and 1 is constructed
as expressing the relationship between the sides of a right triangle where our hypotenuse c is equal to phi
all they 're saying with that first sentence
the radii of the Earth and moon
in proportion to phi
the Earth 's radius and add it to [E2]the moon 's radius , the sum of those two radii
the Earth 's radius and add it to [E2]the moon 's radius , the sum of those two radii[/E2] radii , the ratio of that sum to Earth 's radii[/E2] radii is the square root of phi
you think about the universe a little bit
that video
about this actual question
throughout nature and throughout mathematics
just a fascinating number for a whole set of reasons
a problem to do
the measurements
in terms of Earth radii
1 Earth radii
the entire distance ,
square root of phi Earth radii
the Earth
a part of the Earth
you get the idea
that this height , the height of this right triangle , is square root of phi Earth radii
this entire distance
This segment ,
the radius of the Earth
The Earth
a sphere
that this distance right over here is also 6,371 kilometers
to a fairly simple problem
in two different ways
that everything we 're doing is in kilometers now
as , the combined radii , as 6,371 times the square root of phi
the combined radii
square root of phi times the length of the Earth 's radius
in terms of kilometers
the Earth 's radius
You multiply that times square root of phi
the combined radius
6,371
a 6,371
from both of those terms
that would be [E2]that[/E2] divided by five
95
In either case
five times 19
into nine
I did[/E2] did is I divided both of these numbers by five to figure out how many she can wash per day
190
209
One times 19
eight batteries
$ 10
six batteries
one battery
by eight
5/4
1.25
So 10 divided by eight is the same thing
the number of batteries
times six
1.50
7.50
$ 7.50
Six times five
Six times two
Six times one
six plus one[/E2] one is seven
that hey , this is , six batteries
more comfort in understanding what I 'm doing

a proposed math progression
these , what we call in library mode , where you can just pick and choose which exercises you want to practice , or which videos or articles you want to take a look at
the very core of algebra
the eighth grade mission , the algebra one mission and the algebra two missions
credit for where they overlap
the algebra two mission
that much incremental work
a really solid foundation for algebra
Chemistry too
there is n't math throughout it
there is n't math throughout it , there is n't algebra throughout it , there actually is math throughout chemistry , but
there is n't math throughout it[/E2] it , [E2]there is n't algebra throughout it[/E2] it , there actually is math throughout chemistry , but
the algebra will help [E2]you[/E2] go into
the algebra will help you go into
If you want to go into physics , this is where the algebra , the physics on Khan Academy is currently non - calculus based
what a sine , cosine , tangent of angles are , and the kind of right triangle definitions or the unit circle definitions of those trig functions
probability and statistics
core
geometry
We can keep going
neat area
fascinating ,
which opens up the world up multi variable calculus
a solid foundation in algebra and a bit of foundation in trigonometry
things like SAT , of course the standardized test , that 's a big part of college admissions
a solid indicator of your college readiness
Here are the programming , and you can start programming on Khan Academy for those of you who have n't seen it
a lot of fun
some of your core arithmetic done
Advanced JavaScript
a good sense of what 's available , especially on the math , science side of Khan Academy
you see me do it , look at the video then stop the video and try to do that work over again , do the exercises there , [E2]I[/E2] think you 'll be surprised by how much you can actually learn
a lot of testimonials
from people all walks of life who thought that they were n't good at math , or who thought they were n't good at science
And just as a reminder , this is n't all the content on Khan Academy
some great content on the humanities , history

that our brain is what makes us
what does all of our thinking
what processes all the sensory input from the outside world and creates this reality in our brain that we experience
What is the brain actually made up of ? And it 's primarily made up of neurons
depictions of neurons
by these different neurons
That electrochemical signal going through this neural network
our thought
our intelligence
given that
that your intelligence can actually be changed
that you can grow your muscles
on things that are easy for your muscles to do
things that your muscles have to struggle with
By struggling
a signal to your body
that exact same thing with the brain
how the human brain develops in early childhood
a depiction of the neurons in the brain at birth
over as a child develops [E2]it[/E2] interacts with its environment
over as a child develops it interacts with its environment
It tries things out
This is the the nerves of animals
in unstimulating environments where they 're not around other other animals [E2]They[/E2] ’re in a bare cage
in unstimulating environments where they 're not around other other animals[/E2] animals They ’re in a bare cage
the brain of an animal that is in a stimulating environment that is constantly being challenged that is constantly looking at stimulating new things
And this is n’t just something that I 'm saying nice words
two examples here of someone trying to find the derivative of an expression
Avery
On the left - hand side
" Avery tried to find the derivative , " of seven minus five x using basic differentiation rules
Hannah
these are similar expressions
She took
the derivative of seven
The derivative of a difference is equal to the difference of the derivatives
she could 've said ,
this was equal to the derivative of seven , plus the derivative with respect to x
this was equal to the derivative of seven ,[/E2] , plus the derivative with respect to x
for this one
she had a problem right at step one
the derivative of a constant
that makes sense , [E2]that[/E2] that derivative is zero
that makes [E2]sense[/E2] , that that derivative is zero
the derivative of five x
the derivative with respect to x of x is one
So that the slope here is one
five times one
a similar expression
Derivative of constant is zero
the zero
she 's trying to figure out
that the derivative of a product is equal to the product of the derivatives
a mistake
at step one
the correct way to go
to eight
What she did is , she is assuming , she tried to take the derivative of eight and multiply [E2]that[/E2] times the derivative of x
What she did is , she is assuming , she tried to take [E2]the derivative of eight and multiply that times the derivative of x
the derivative of eight and multiply [E2]that[/E2] times the derivative of x , that is not the way it works
the derivative of eight and multiply that times the derivative of x[/E2] x , that is not the way it works
In the future
something called the product rule
the wrong step
instead of getting a final answer of eight , she is getting a final answer of , she assumes well the derivative of eight is zero , times the derivative of x is one
zero , which is not the right answer
at step three
that g of x is equal to x squared plus 5
what is h of g of negative 6 ?
our function composition symbol
as , this is going to be the same thing as g of negative 6 , and then h of that
h of g of negative 6
the second notation far more intuitive
that number
into the function h
36 minus 33 , which is equal to 3
You input negative 6 into g
to just h of 3
into h
So , that 's the number 3 , so h of 3 is going to be 3 times 3 minus 1 , 3 minus 1 squared
2 squared , [E2]this[/E2] is 2 right over here , minus 5 , which is equal to 3 times 4 minus 5 , which is equal to 12 minus 5 , which is equal to 7
2 squared[/E2] squared , this is 2 right over here , minus 5 , which is equal to 3 times 4 minus 5 , which is equal to 12 minus 5 , which is equal to 7
that output
Here I 've drawn the most classic parabola
y is equal to x squared
What would [E2]this[/E2] look like
this yellow curve
0 , and we square it , 0 squared
us to y
to y minus k
at k
at k , right over there
at least for this point
the effect of shifting up the y value by k
For this yellow curve
For [E2]this yellow curve
this yellow curve , [E2]you[/E2] square this x value
this yellow curve[/E2] curve , you square this x value
for this curve right over here
y minus k
this curve[/E2] curve is essentially [E2]this blue curve[/E2] curve shifted up by k
a constant k , the vertical distance[/E2] distance between these two parabolas
This vertical distance
a constant k
the value you would get for y when you just square 0
y is equal to 0
y equals 0 over here
whatever value you were squaring here to get your y
, whatever value you were squaring here to get your y , you now have to have an h higher value to square that same thing
, [E2]whatever value you were squaring here to get your y[/E2] y , you now have to have an h higher value to square that same thing
1 squared , clearly not drawn to scale
now to square 1
the net effect
that instead of squaring just x , but squaring x minus h , we shifted the curve to the right
the curve--
by h
negative 2x squared
a sense of how we can shift parabolas around
the graph of y equals x squared
the vertex being at 0[/E2] 0 , 0[/E2] 0 , the vertex-- or the lowest , or I guess you could say the minimum or the maximum point , the extreme point in the parabola , this point right over here
the vertex being at 0 , 0 , [E2]the vertex-- or the lowest , or I guess you could say the minimum or the maximum point , the extreme point in the parabola , this point right over here
Instead of [E2]the vertex being at 0
the vertex being at 0 , 0 , [E2]the vertex-- or the lowest , or I guess you could say the minimum or the maximum point , the extreme point in the parabola , this point right over here[/E2] here , would be the maximum point for a downward opening parabola , a minimum point for an upward opening parabola-- that 's going to be shifted
the vertex being at 0[/E2] 0 , 0[/E2] 0 , the vertex-- or the lowest , or I guess you could say the minimum or the maximum point , the extreme point in the parabola , this point right over here , would be the maximum point for a downward opening parabola , a minimum point for an upward opening parabola-- that 's going to be shifted
that 's A
into a flat line
kind of a broad - opening thing like that
greater than negative 1
a broad - opening thing like that
At negative 1
like a reflection of our original curve
a good way of how to shift and scale parabolas

that we have the sum one minus one plus one minus one plus one and just keeps going on and on and on like that forever and we can write that with sigma notation
the sum from n is equal to one lower case n equals one to infinity
an infinite number of terms
that this is negative 1 to the lowercase n minus 1 power
negative 1 to the 0 power , which is that
When n is equal to 2 , [E2]it[/E2] 's 2 minus 1
When n is equal to 2 , it 's 2 minus 1
negative one to the first power that 's equal to that right over there
a way of writing this series
the sum of the first two terms
the sum of the first three terms , which is of course equal to
S sub 4 , [E2]we could keep going[/E2] going , S sub four
we could keep going
does this sum converge to some finite value
in order for a series to converge
that means [E2]that[/E2] the limit , an infinite series to converge , that means that the limit , the limit , so if you 're a convergence , convergence is the same thing , is the same thing as saying that the limit as capital , the limit as capital N approaches infinity of our partial sums is equal to some finite
that means that the limit , an infinite series to converge[/E2] converge , that means that the limit , the limit , so if you 're a convergence , convergence is the same thing , is the same thing as saying that the limit as capital , the limit as capital N approaches infinity of our partial sums is equal to some finite

that you can get a version of this a live stream in podcast
- Thanks for having me Sal
a really fascinating , I guess career where now you 're the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
maybe a good place to start
I think most people have a general idea that there 's something called the Federal Reserve and affects things like monetary policy and interest rates
these regional banks of which you 're a president of one of them
our jobs
we do a bunch of things , we regulate banks , we provide cash
Neel
day
two goals fundamental goals that Congress has given us
these two goals are intention
are the levers at the Federal Reserves
by lowering interest rates
it cheaper for a family to get a mortgage to buy a house or for a business to get a loan to go build a factory
how we stimulate the economy
there 's a clear answer
All of the monetary policy and the monetary stimulus has been going in
all the sense in the world
all the sense in[/E2] in the world
for all the reasons you just said especially in service sector , retail jobs , travel airlines they are suffering
for all the reasons you just said especially in[/E2] in service sector , retail jobs , travel airlines they are suffering
the cost of buying certain things
it can stimulate some demand
people can continue to invest in certain areas
companies
But it does seem like there 's this divergence
people have talked about the K - shaped economic recovery , where to some degree those who do have access to capital even people who own houses , when interest rates go down they can refinance they benefit
that 's very fair
the K - shaped recovery is real
Companies like General Mills
The monetary policy
a blunt instrument that affects the whole economy at the same time
your view there
Biden
in Washington
a debate where it looks like the Biden administration wants to be more aggressive on the stimulus while the Republican members of Congress wanna be a little bit more conservative
I think [E2]I[/E2] 've been very vocal and I 'll continue to be vocal saying the job market today in America is as bad as the worst job market during the financial crisis
my basic message
we are nowhere close to having rebuilt our economy and putting people back to work ,
in the unemployment
Inflation
for 10 years
before the pandemic
But something really curious happened in this pandemic ,
more money
We 're not taking vacations and trips
at some point we have to get our fiscal house in order , we have to make tough choices as a country
the capacity to do it
COVID-19
there 's gon na be structural changes to the economy because of what we 're going through it with COVID
we 've all figured out , you figure this out Sal , a long time ago but we all the rest of us figured out that you can actually work remotely very effectively in many
that the use of technology like this is going to be permanently higher than it was before the pandemic
1100
all the 50 or 70 of them
we have 1100 employees in our bank

we 'd all be better off if people had the basic skills they needed at the front end so they do n't have to kind of learn by making mistakes

as someone who used to work in the investment world
that when it comes to individual stock picking there 's many very smart people who are doing a lot of research and still is a very hard job
my old boss used to tell me , anytime you think you have a good investment idea when you 're buying a stock , someone else is selling that stock to you , so you 've got to believe that you know something that they do n't
anyone of any age but especially young people
I 'll just add to that [E2]I[/E2] used to my day job for seven years was an analyst at Hedge fund where all we did is essentially pick stocks and like you , my 401k I have it in some diversified mutual funds but I own no individual stocks right now ( laughs ) all of our savings I bought some rental properties ( laughs ) that my say

The one common thread for me
I always pursue things I 'm really interested in that I think are important that I think are challenging
So there 's been no plan
a variety of different things
my message is pursue things you 're genuinely interested in and life is long your first job
along the way you never dreamt that you 'd be running this a not - for - profit educating millions of people around the world
a lot of daydreams , some of which came true
the ratings agencies that were approving putting a high rating on sliced and diced securities that were questionable in value
most of us even though I now run a not - for - profit and you run a semi - quasi independent government institution I would say we both arguably believe in free markets and part of the best corrective force on free markets is kind of you deal with the consequences of your actions
the conversations
it was like a forest fire
a strong advocate since I joined the Minneapolis Fed
much stronger regulations on the biggest banks

For f
for given values of x
f , [E2]they[/E2] tell us for given values of x what f of x is equal to
f , they tell us for given values of x what f[/E2] f of x is equal to
f , they tell [E2]us[/E2] for given values of x what f of x is equal to
f , they tell us [E2]for given values of x[/E2] x what f of x[/E2] x is equal to
in terms of this kind of absolute value expression
in terms of both f of x
the notation of writing this , the derivative of h of x
h prime of nine
We get a derivative
that same white color
This is going to be the same thing as the derivative with respect to x of three times
a little bit neater
The derivative of a scalar times [E2]the function
three times f prime of x
the derivative of [E2]the sum of two things
the derivative of [E2]the sum of two things[/E2] things is the sum of the derivatives
The derivative of a scalar times something
the same thing as a scalar times the derivative of that something
straight from here
to here
this interesting , well now [E2]we[/E2] can evaluate this function
H prime of nine
the same thing as three times f prime of nine
when x is equal to nine , f of nine is one but more importantly f prime of nine is three
This part right over here
that part 's three
g prime of nine
that could be interesting
a minimum point
G of one
after that
Absolute value of one
the absolute value for x is greater than or equal to , not greater than or equal to zero
this thing right over here
X is greater than or equal to one
to x minus one
Which is the same thing as just x , minus one
the absolute value of a negative number that 's going to be the opposite
Absolute value of negative eight
positive eight
two minus x
the slope of that
For x is greater or equal to one , we would look at this expression
our slope
For x less than one or [E2]our slope[/E2] slope now
For x less than one[/E2] one or our slope now
For the pointing question ,
G prime of nine
What does [E2]this[/E2] evaluate to
The slope of the tangent line of h when x is equal to nine
a restaurant owner installed a new automated drink machine
The owner
that the machine may be dispensing too much in medium drinks
the hypothesis where things are happening as expected
as the no difference hypothesis
a statement of equality where the population parameter is equal to a value where the value is what people were kind of assuming all along
a claim where if you have evidence to back up that claim , that would be new news
hey there 's something interesting going on here
the no difference , [E2]we[/E2] would say the null hypothesis would be , we would care about the population parameter , and here we care about the average amount of drink dispensed in the medium setting
the no difference , we would say the null hypothesis would be , we would care about the population parameter , and here we care about the average amount of drink dispensed in the medium setting
the population parameter there
the drink machine is supposed to do
the alternative hypothesis
that the mean actually might be larger than that , larger than 530 milliliters
They decide to take a sample of 30 medium drinks to see if the average amount
about proportions
Only these two
with the mean
the difference between [E2]this one
this one[/E2] one and this one[/E2] one is this says the mean is greater than 530 milliliters , and that indeed is the owner 's fear
this over here , this alternative hypothesis
that the , that it 's dispensing on average less than 530 milliliters , but that 's not what the owner is afraid of
the kind of the news that we 're trying to find some evidence for
choice C
A statistics class at a large high school
that students at their school[/E2] school are getting less than eight hours of sleep on average
42 of these students
The mean from this sample ,
7.5 hours
an appropriate ending to their alternative hypothesis
the null hypothesis
hey there 's actually no news here , that everything is what people were always assuming
the null hypothesis here
that no , the students are getting at least eight hours of sleep per night
that would be , [E2]that[/E2] remember we care about the population of students
about the population of students at the school
well the null hypothesis is that the parameter for the students at that school , the mean amount of sleep that they 're getting , is indeed greater than or equal to eight hours
that students at their school are getting less than eight hours of sleep on average
that the population parameter , the population mean , for their school is actually less than eight hours
the average amount of sleep students at their school get per night
less than eight hours
one thing to watch out for
a population mean
a population proportion
the other thing [E2]that sometimes folks get stuck up on ,
that sometimes folks get stuck up on ,[/E2] , but the other thing that sometimes confuses folks is ,[/E2] , well we are measuring ,[/E2] , is that we are calculating a statistic from a sample
the sample mean
the population
Your hypotheses are claims about
eight sin of X over four
is equal to three , just subtracted 11 , both sides
3/8
my X axis
my Y axis
that 's theta
that 's theta , [E2]we[/E2] know that the sin of theta is equal to the Y coordinate of where this radius intersects the unit circle
that 's theta[/E2] theta , we know [E2]that the sin of theta[/E2] theta is equal to the Y coordinate of where this radius intersects the unit circle
that if we add an arbitrary number of two pies here or if we subtract an arbitrary number of two pis , we go all the way around the unit circle , back to where we began and so the sin of theta would be the same
that sin of theta
instead of just saying , sin of X over four is equal to 3/8
that sin of X over four plus any integer
a negative one , a negative two
if we solve now for X , is this going to give us the most general solution set
The Y coordinate
if we start at pi radians , which would be right over there and we were to subtract theta , we 're going to get the same thing
as pi minus theta
you could keep trying it out for any theta , even the theta that put [E2]you[/E2] in the second quadrant
that sin of pi minus theta
sin of X over four is equal to 3/8
that sin of pi minus X over four
the other principle that we can add 2 pi or subtract two pi from this , an arbitrary number of times and the sin of that will still be equal to 3/8
X over four
two pi N
is equal to the inverse sin of 3/8 , minus two pi N
X is equal to four times the inverse sin of 3/8 minus eight pi N
pi minus X over four plus two pi N is equal to the inverse sin of 3/8
pi
negative X over four
by negative four
X is equal to negative four times the inverse sin of 3/8 plus four pi plus eight pi N
the union of both of these
this idea of what is a sentence
syntax
this concept of , basically grammatical order
what a sentence is
into all of that
in much greater detail
the definition [E2]that you and I came up with ,
that you and I came up with ,[/E2] , Paige ,[/E2] , is that a sentence is a grammatically complete idea
a bunch of words that say one complete thing
what we call the subject
the verb part , which is the predicate
a sentence has
the predicate
the noun chunk that is performing the action of the sentence
Is this a sentence
our subject
am
a verb
a subject and a predicate
the noun or pronoun part
the action that it is performing
so [E2]this[/E2] is
so this is
how all of this is predicate
in the blue box
kinda like an invisible , secret subject
that muffin

that they made it very difficult to amend The Constitution
what they had in mind , whether they thought , " Well , the House , the Senate , the states , " they 'll sort of be all run by the same kind of people " and they 'll kind of agree on things
these kind of waves
in our history
Constitutional
What do [E2]you[/E2] think brings those waves on
that we 're gon na have a Constitutional amendment anytime in the near future
the 27th amendment
what 's [E2]the 27th amendment[/E2] amendment about
It 's words on a page , you know
the text is fine
all the right things
We 're told
the growth of bacteria , [E2]a scientist[/E2] scientist measure the area in square millimeters occupied by a sample population
the growth of bacteria , a scientist measure the area in square millimeters occupied by a sample population
0.4
The growth of the population
is equal to 24 times e to the 0.4 times t power where t is the number of hours since the experiment began
how as time goes on , the square millimeters of our little bacterial population keeps going , and it clearly is growing , or it looks like it 's growing exponentially
the graph[/E2] graph , here is the graph[/E2] graph of f
Here is [E2]the graph
that graph
which statement
the meaning of the intersection point of the graph
the solution to the equation 24 times e to the 0.4 t is equal to 600
y is equal to 600
a t value
the situation where the area of the population occupies is equal to the number of hours
the area the population occupies after 600 hours
This t axis
to 600 hours
two populations
the growth of population A can be modeled by f of t
is equal to that
when do the populations occupy the same area
that it looks like they intersect right around there
the point at which they 're going to occupy the same area
when does it happen ?
And it looks like it happens after about five hours
the same setup
which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs
it means that the populations both occupied about 180 square millimeters at the same time
that at the beginning , population A was larger than population B
the point of intersection
what population was larger to begin with
population A
the blue curve
for true statements
which statements represent the meaning , the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs
the solution to equation 24 times e to the 0.4 t
in the last example where we only had one curve
another way to say it
we 're at the t value where this
the solution to the equation
in a different color , which is right over here
our horizontal axis
I have the graph of y is equal to f of t here
in terms of time , in terms of seconds
we could say its period is equal to two pi
if we wanna put the units we could say two pi , two pi seconds per cycle
if we wanna put the units we could say two pi[/E2] pi , two pi[/E2] pi seconds per cycle
for seconds
we could write its frequency is equal to one over two pi cycles per second
as hertz
with cosine of t
these weights
how much they involve it
okay , this has a lot more of cosine of t in it
like a very clean sinusoid , not like a square wave
This has a frequency of one over two pi
This has a frequency[/E2] frequency of one over two pi
This has [E2]a frequency of one over two pi
this has twice the frequency
a frequency of one over two pi
a frequency[/E2] frequency of one over two pi
well , okay , this
in the study of differential equations
Another really interesting thing about this
you can view these coefficients as they are ,
that tells you [E2]that[/E2] that function contains a lot more of the one over two pi hertz frequency
that tells you that that function contains a lot more of the one over two pi hertz frequency
that tells [E2]you[/E2] that that function contains a lot more of the one over two pi hertz frequency
In order to understand how [E2]we[/E2] can actually find these coefficients
In order to understand how we can actually find these coefficients
a little bit of our trigonometry , especially integrating trig functions
The first one
sodium chloride
magnesium chloride
C12 - H22 - O11 , which in other words is sucrose
each of them
the first thing [E2]that you might realize
that you might realize[/E2] realize , is that sodium chloride , this is an ionic compound
of up of a sodium positively charged ion
about their relative sizes
the atom , a sodium atom versus a chlorine atom , the general trend
as you go to the right and you have more electrons in that outer most shell , the radius tends to actually get smaller
about ions
an electron configuration of neon
that the chloride anion , is going to be larger than the sodium cation
a negative charge
okay , well that 's the solute , but where is
ionic compounds
well into water
that the sodium cation , has an electron configuration of neon , and oxygen is pretty cool close to that
the oxygen atom
The electrons
a little bit more time
around the oxygen
than around the hydrogens
an oxygen with two hydrogens
in this white color
what would their orientation be
that the electrons spend more time around the oxygen
in many videos
the oxygen end
a partial negative charge
the orientation of a water molecule
that the partially negative oxygen end , will be attracted to the positive ions
the positively charged hydrogen ends
to the negative ions
oxygen and then the two hydrogens
the hydrogens , that end of the water molecule
a partially positive charge
the two hydrogens and then the oxygen
you get the idea of what the water would kind of look like and how it would be oriented
the solute
What would [E2]the solute[/E2] solute look like
What would the solute look like
the relative sizing
the magnesium ions
two plus
for every one of those
the partially positive the hydrogen ends of the water
to the negative chloride anions
the oxygen end of the water molecules
to these plus two charge magnesium ions
another one just like that
the reason why it[/E2] it dissolves in water well
a sucrose molecule has parts of the molecule that have polarity to it
a lot of OH groups
For the sake of time
For [E2]the sake of time
the sake of time , [E2]I[/E2] have n't drawn the water molecules
the sake of time[/E2] time , I have n't drawn the water molecules
what allows it to dissolve well into a polar solvent like water

the notion of unemployment
at length
how it jumps around , along with the economic cycles
recessions
how the unemployment rate jumps during most of these recessions , or really all of these recessions here
other things graphed
this thing in blue , known as the natural rate of unemployment
this blue line , and it 's really an approximation , of what would the unemployment rate be if you did not have these economic cycles
as the smoothed out unemployment rate
NRU
the two , [E2]that[/E2] 's the unemployment caused by the business cycle
at ,
when the unemployment rate , when the regular unemployment rate is very high , your cyclical unemployment , the unemployment caused due to the business cycle , is going to be positive
when the unemployment rate ,[/E2] , when the regular unemployment rate is very high ,[/E2] , your cyclical unemployment ,[/E2] , the unemployment caused due to the business cycle ,[/E2] , is going to be positive
negative cyclical unemployment
this notion of natural rate of unemployment
into two components
You can break it down into structural
in this blue color
the exact data that here
the structural
one thing that you might immediately say
okay , the natural rate
when the car was replacing the horse and buggy , if you are a horse and buggy driver , or you were good caring for horses
a situation with structural unemployment
the skills
to where people are
the people
in the place where the jobs are
out of the ideas that there are some frictions when you look for a job
You 've got to submit your resume

the frictional unemployment
Over time
an appreciation that you often see the unemployment
the natural rate of unemployment[/E2] unemployment itself
into structural and frictional unemployment

In other videos
to the idea of orbitals
Aufbau
from German
the building principle
a very useful way of thinking about electron configurations past calcium
the electron configuration of neon
neon
an atomic number of 10
that fill [E2]that[/E2] first shell
six more electrons to get to 10
the order of the subshells that we just filled
In this first row
that first shell
In this second row or this second period
that second shell
the noble gas configuration or the noble gas notation
all right we 're going to be building off of neon
from neon
into the 3s subshell
3s2
on this diagram over here
from 2s
to 2p
the electron configuration of calcium
20 protons
a neutral calcium
20 electrons
off of argon
calcium 's electron configuration
the same as argon
1s
2s
2p
to 3p
the surprise and why this Aufbau diagram is useful
the extra electrons
For electron configuration purposes
scandium
one more proton than calcium
21 protons
a similar electron configuration
in the 4s subshell
an accurate electron configuration for scandium
that would have a positive charge
to 4s
to 3d
about building
about the electron configuration
for electron configuration purposes , 3d
to 4p
So the big takeaway here is the Aufbau principle that you 'll learn , this type of diagram
one other thing that I want you to appreciate based on what we just learned
patterns in the periodic table of elements
for which elements
our S subshell
which elements
their P subshells
one reason why folks might have called it the D block
if you really imagine the Aufbau principle as building up atoms , it might be tempting to say , oh well we 're building in the fourth row here , we 're building the 3d subshell
that that actually is n't true

that this is like taking 8 tomatoes and adding 7 blueberries and then saying , "
you 've given a try
the way [E2]I 'm going to think about it
I 'm going to think about it[/E2] it is , I 'm going to keep adding tomatoes until I fill up my first bucket of 10 and then I 'm going to see how many more I have to add to get , to essentially , add a total of 7
to those 8 tomatoes
a group of 10
2 of the blueberries
some more blueberries to add
10 pieces of fruit

the proportional relationship between the number of hours a business operates and its total cost of electricity is shown in the following graph , all right
a proportional relationship
that constant of proportionality is going to be
that proportional relationship where our total cost is going to be equal to our constant of proportionality , 30 , times our number of hours
the total cost
The y - coordinate of point A
the total cost of electricity
to what I just said
hey , this looks kinda close to $ 35 , but that 's why it was useful for us to write this relationship right over here , because what we see is that our total cost is going to be 30 times our number of hours

What is [E2]y[/E2] going to be here ?
I need to raise b to to get to one

In general when you 're taking an inverse you 're going to reflect over the line
the power I need to raise b to to get to four
right over here , b to the first power is equal to four

he told me he does that[/E2] that is he says when people understand algebra , it gives him confidence that[/E2] that they have the critical thinking and analytical skills to tackle pretty much any problem in any domain
that is the practical reason why algebra is so powerful
beyond that
It 's a form
It 's [E2]a form
a form , [E2]it[/E2] 's a way of representing pure ideas in the universe and our minds

In these lessons
that the value of the function this means that the function is sitting above the x - axis
above the x - axis in this place right over here that I am highlighting in yellow
it 's positive
the value of our function
c
X is
we could write it there ,
the intervals when our function is positive
then we see that f of x is below the x - axis
here or , or [E2]x[/E2] is between b or c
here or , or x is [E2]between b or c
between b or c
less than or equal to
the easiest way for me to think about it
as you increase x you 're going to be increasing y
It starts
a , d , b
right between d and e
You increase your x
You increase [E2]your x
You [E2]increase your x
your x , your [E2]y[/E2] has decreased
your x[/E2] x , your y has decreased
your x , your [E2]y has decreased
your x , your y has decreased
you increase your x
y has decreased
increase your x
increase [E2]your x
all the way until this point over here
between d and e
the same intervals
the intervals where we 're positive or negative
with when we are increasing or decreasing
The center of this circle
O
, I actually just did some pull - ups
the center of this circle
part of a right triangle
one of the two shorter sides of a right triangle
OF
its hypotenuse
OA
the hypotenuse of a right triangle
the Pythagorean theorem
that 7 squared , let 's call this x
that 7 squared
7 squared
4 times 4
96
4 times 2
576
9 plus 8
17 , 576
575
50 plus 575
that 25 times 25 is 625
a radius of the circle
OG
OC
the radius of the circle is 25
for this triangle
that a squared plus the square root of 141 squared-- I 'll just write that as 141 - - so plus 141 is going to be equal to 25 squared , which we already know to be 625
5 minus 1 is 4
5 minus 1
484
a squared is equal to 484
242
121
2 times 242 , which is 2 times 121 , which is the same thing as 11
this is 2 squared-- so 484 , I 'll write it[/E2] it over here
the same thing as 2 times 11 squared
in this case [E2]a[/E2] is equal to-- let me just clean all that up so I have some space to work with--
the length of segment OF
225
that b squared plus 15 squared , which is the same thing as 225 - - 15 squared is 225 - - is going to be equal to 25 squared , is going to be equal to 625
b squared
is equal to 400
segment OA
some example questions here from Khan Academy
on arc measure
this first question
what is the arc measure , in degrees , of arc AC on circle P below
about the minor arc
the right[/E2] right , the shorter arc
it 's a little bit to [E2]the right
that central angle
I 'll do it in this blue color
angle , let me do it in a different color , I 'll do it in this blue color , that central angle[/E2] angle is angle[/E2] angle C , P , A
angle , let me do it in a different color[/E2] color , [E2]I 'll do it in this blue color[/E2] color , that central angle is angle C , P , A
the arc measure , in degrees , of arc AC
in the figure below ,
so this is point A , this is point D , so segment AD is this one[/E2] one right over here
so this is point A , this is point D , so segment AD is this one right over here
so this is point A ,[/E2] , this is point D ,[/E2] , so segment AD is this one right over here
AD right over there[/E2] there , AD and CE
AD right over there , AD and CE
That 's [E2]AD right over there
That 's AD right over there
diameters of the circle
diameters
So , those are di--
diameters of the circle P
the arc measure of AB , of arc AB in degrees
arc AB
the central angle that intercepts that arc
from geometry , which we 're still learning as we do this example problem
that vertical angles are going to have the same measure
This angle right here
55 degrees
the figure below , and it does n't quite fit on the page , but we 'll scroll down in a second , [E2]AB[/E2] is the diameter of circle P
the figure below ,[/E2] , and it does n't quite fit on the page ,[/E2] , but we 'll scroll down in a second ,[/E2] , AB is the diameter of circle P
straight across , straight across the circle
the arc measure of A , B , C
in degrees
us go the long way around
a major arc they 're talking about
the arc measure of arc A , B , C
a major arc
the arc measure of this major arc A , B , C.

a lot of experience with the geometric series
what the common ratio is
N to the tenth power over N factorial , and factorial we know also grows very , very quickly
tenth
the same thing as N plus one times N factorial
a fixed common ratio
This ratio
a function of N
kind of some voodoo
this down here is going to be , actually you can figure it out , this is going to be N to the 11th plus N to the tenth power , so[/E2] so the limit as N approaches infinity , well this denominator
It 's going to be a tenth degree polynomial , and [E2]this down here is going to be , actually you can figure it out , this is going to be N to the 11th plus N to the tenth power , so
by N
to the tenth
the ratio between consecutive terms
if we use the logic from our common ratio up here when we looked at geometric series , this is clearly not a geometric series , but we would say , " Well , look , as N gets really , really , really large the ratio between " consecutive terms gets smaller
the same conclusion
the same conclusion that " therefore this series actually converges
this statement
all the ratio test tells us
if we have an infinite series
an infinite series
If this approaches some limit , if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio[/E2] ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger
If this approaches some limit , if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger
If this approaches some limit , [E2]if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger
If this approaches some limit [E2], if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger
if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio[/E2] ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , [E2]the ratio[/E2] ratio tells us if L is less than one
if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger[/E2] larger and larger[/E2] larger , the ratio tells us if L is less than one
if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , the ratio tells [E2]us[/E2] if L is less than one
if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , the ratio tells us if L is less than one
, if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio[/E2] ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , [E2]the ratio[/E2] ratio tells us if L is less than one , which was the situation here , L is clearly less than one , then the series converges
, if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger[/E2] larger and larger[/E2] larger , the ratio tells us if L is less than one , which was the situation here , L is clearly less than one , then the series converges
, if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , the ratio tells [E2]us[/E2] if L is less than one , which was the situation here , L is clearly less than one , then the series converges
, [E2]if this approaches some limit , so once again , this limit is what is going to be our ratio between consecutive terms as N gets larger and larger , the ratio tells us if L is less than one[/E2] one , which was the situation here , L is clearly less than one[/E2] one , then the series converges
Some definitions
it 's absolutely convergent , it converges
Series
then series diverges
if L is equal to one it 's inconclusive
the essence of the ratio test
at the idea of representing a periodic function as a set of weighted cosines and sines
a formula for a sub zero
a coefficient in general
for any of the coefficients on the cosines
for all of the terms
for an infinite number of terms
that sine of the definite integral from zero to 2 pi of sine of nt , dt is going to be equal to zero for n being any integer
We saw that
this property
that when the coefficient on the t is a non - zero integer , that this is going to result in pi
that all of this stuff right over here , we 'll do that in a different color , all of , we know that all of this stuff is going to evaluate , or actually we should say , all of this stuff is going to become pi , so we know that b sub n times pi is going to be equal to this definite integral
let me write it this way , b sub n times pi
b sub n
I 'll put my dt out here , of f of t , f of t times sine of nt , sine of nt , dt , and so we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll
I 'll put my dt out here , of f of t , f of t times sine of nt , sine of nt , dt , and so [E2]we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll
I 'll put my dt out here[/E2] here , of f of t , f of t times sine of nt , sine of nt , dt , and so we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll
we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll , we get [E2]b sub n[/E2] n , actually
we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll[/E2] roll , we get b sub n , actually
we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll , we get b sub n , actually
we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and [E2]we get a little bit of a drum roll , we get b sub n[/E2] n , actually
I 'll put my dt out here , of f of t , f of t times sine of nt , sine of nt , dt , and so we can then divide both sides by , divide both sides by pi and we get a little bit of a drum roll , we get [E2]b sub n[/E2] n , actually , I could write that

well we would love you to do the same thing with the team just talk about what you 're doing etcetera
about just how you
fashion , the world
does someone get in to it and especially get to the level that you 've gotten
the greatest thing that anybody can do when they 're young is discover their passion and what they love
it sounds really , really terrible
the only industry I had to
a really strong opinion on what everybody else was doing
a professor say that we call you a merchant
My university degree
in merchandising and marketing

this balance
someday as you guys start to take over the world , you 're going to have to also start to introduce some right brain curriculum and the Burberry Foundation would be honored to help you start creating some of those things when you 're already down the road [ unintelligible ]
Christopher
that the curriculum specifically in America has become so left brain , so much of the arts and things have been cut out
for where the world 's going we need creative thinkers
left brain
as many of them as we can
a whole another world that companies like us need
it 's incredible
Okay I 'll be a merchant
what happens always is when you discover who you are and you discover your passion and then it 's not work at your life and so you just get in to that zone
in my lane
a footballer
I did n't jump around
all that I 've done
you direct your energy and you become so passionate and you unite people , right ?
I do n't have to
I do n't want to over simplify [E2]it[/E2] but I found my zone

Sal : [E2]I[/E2] mean following on that
What coffee
You might have Apple products
that brand
In that way
To me
a part of what a great brand is
2006
about these things
through a lot
We had our own weaving facility in the North of England
We had [E2]our own weaving facility in the North of England

your core products proposition
Then also what is your core purpose
people just want to work , I think people all want deeper meaning in their lives
It was hard for us
his spirit lives on
it should
that is our core , that 's what he founded the company on
the trench coat the most cool , relevant , hip thing in the world
Nobody else
but us
nearly every item that goes down
some type of
Harvard Business
the great article on just that topic revitalizing the core
Sal : I mean how do you decide on [E2]that[/E2] ?
Sal : I mean how do you decide on that ?
just a gut instinct
at all the brands that have a core
we always say that we are a creative thinking company and everything we do is driven by intuition
with facts
that we do value feeling over knowing
all the ones that are very fact based
Our instincts
we had to go direct to consumer , we had to control the brand , the environment , everything
in front of the board
everything 's outlined
exactly where we 're going
At the very end
At [E2]the very end
the very end [E2]they[/E2] told the board
the very end[/E2] end they told the board
this guy
what you used to decide where you 're going to go

, and I told them upfront after that six months
If they do n't believe , and [E2]I[/E2] told them upfront after that six months I said , " If you do not believe " " that we 're going to do this , " " then maybe you should go now

in every single store we have , we need left brain and we need right
the engagement
The probability of a company doing it twice
what really took the odds down

I son't know
how I feel
how I feel and if you
that by itself
really powerful advice
that every year we only do three new things
a lot and not all buying but engaging and spreading what the brand 's about , etcetera
burberry.com
That 's not individual products
new initiatives like burberry.com
so heavy investment , lot of focus going there , so digital mobile etcetera
operational or internal initiatives
areas
We do
the results that we budgeted , etcetera
this year 's results
with a local institution
a million dollars
a big part of the balance
we do n't want tissue rejection because it 's tough to bring people into your culture
to such rigor
Are they culturally compatible
with anybody going to the next level
there is transparency , trust , our core values , all those soft things we talked about
a certain level [E2]it[/E2] 's a given
a certain level it 's a given
their smart
a given
they have high IQ but we need high EQ
that we can teach people anything but we ca n't teach them to care , we ca n't teach them to feel and when you 're in a human business and you 're communicating like we 're communicating , they have to be authentic
a leadership council which is the next generation talent
a part of our talent plan
investors
you would be so surprised at every decision I do n't make everyday
something that you think you can
I mean [E2]you[/E2] talk about personality fit
I mean you talk about personality fit
the whole book
like stem is , it should be a right - brained activity
in my mind
like a painter learning how to paint
The real expression is when you actually create something so [E2]I[/E2] actually think we 're more similar Angela
that 's your unique brand positioning
You 're taking what most people would take as a traditional left - brain and [E2]you[/E2] 're adding fun to it
You 're taking what most people would take as a traditional left - brain and you 're adding fun to it

about all of his different philanthropic efforts etcetera and to the who 's who of the UK
the Khan Academy
a follow up note afterwards saying , " Could we continue the conversation , " " I found it fascinating , etcetera
that I am absolutely nothing in comparison to the people that are watching you , the people that are following you , the lives that you 're impacting
You 're impacting teachers lives
the next generation
people who did n't finish their education
a phenomenal brand
in such a modern way
that America need you to do this
that America need [E2]you to do this
you to do this
the biggest issue that inhibiting future economies all over the world
I am so honored to be here to chat with you and just [E2]I[/E2] am so thankful for what you 're doing ,
like going back to work now
Heathrow
for me personally
the amount of time people spend on the site
the website
a white background like this
some type of study that says people like to spend more time on yellow backgrounds
that 's true
a hypothesis that if you actually have a yellow background
how do you test
almost all research
some form of hypothesis testing
Hypotheses
as your null hypothesis
Skeptics
that , hey , it 's hard to make a difference in this world
the alternative hypothesis ,
that the mean time on the yellow site ,[/E2] , on the yellow site ,[/E2] , is actually different
this yellow site
On the other hand
about just the general distribution of the amount of time people spend on the site
for this sake
that it 's a normal distribution , and normal distributions
for this sake , assume that it 's a normal distribution , and normal distributions are very important , and/or things that are close to normal distributions , for hypothesis testing
that mean
one of the things we 're going to talk about in future videos
if you have this distribution , you can actually come up with another distribution of the means of samples you might get
N ,
this distribution is going to look like the one on the left , but it 's going to be narrower around that mean
the distribution that if I were to take a sample of the amount of time people spend on the site and calculate the means , this is the distribution of those sample means I might get
the center of this distribution
our mean for white which is equal to the mean for yellow
amount of time that someone might spend
a sample mean you might get for a time that you sampled 1,000 people and you calculated the mean , and you see that there 's a low probability for it
your sample of 1,000
The center
20 minutes
at this probability , which would be these yellow areas there
to some pre - specified threshold
that threshold
5 %
1 %
Hey , that was a very low probability " of getting a result at least this extreme " if we assume the null hypothesis
the the null hypothesis is for sure false
if we assume the null hypothesis , there 's a very low probability of getting a result at least as extreme as what we just got
In future videos
into much more depth into all of this
that h of x is equal to the negative cube root of three x minus six plus 12
that what an inverse does is
A function
from a domain
to a range
we want to come up with an expression that unwinds whatever this does
that y , if we say that y is equal to h of x
of y
as a member of the range
some expression that 's a function of y
that being equal to x
the inverse mapping
Another way [E2]you could do that
you could do that[/E2] that , is you could just swap x and y
that 's a little bit less intuitive [E2]that[/E2] this is actually the inverse
And we would get y minus 12 is equal to the cube root of
And we would get y minus 12 is equal to [E2]the cube root[/E2] root of
the cube root
of this negative here
by negative one
On the left hand side
On [E2]the left hand side
the left hand side , we 'll [E2]that[/E2] 's the same thing as 12 minus y
the left hand side[/E2] side , we 'll that 's the same thing as 12 minus y
on [E2]the right hand side
the right hand side , [E2]we[/E2] 're gon na get the cube root of three x minus six
the right hand side[/E2] side , we 're gon na get the cube root of three x minus six
with 12 minus y cubed
And on the right hand side , well you take the cube of the cube root , you 're just gon na be left with what you originally had under the cube root sign
And on the right hand side , well [E2]you take the cube of the cube root , you 're just gon na be left with what you originally had under the cube root sign
you take the cube of the cube root , you 're just gon na be left with what you originally had under the cube root sign , [E2]I[/E2] guess you could say
you take the cube of the cube root , you 're just gon na be left with what you originally had under the cube root sign[/E2] sign , I guess you could say
the inverse function
well it could be anything
h inverse of star and we 're just naming our input star is equal to 12 minus star cubed plus six over three
h inverse of x
the input function
to a function partially anything
to a function[/E2] function partially anything
that is our inverse function , that essentially unwinds what our original function does
What numbers should replace " the A and B in the multiplication table ?
The way you think about it
It goes up to six
Ok , three
that 3 times 4 is 12
the same row as this five and the same column as that 5
that five times five is 25
that if you go in any row , you 're counting by that number
in this two 's column right over here
by twos
fives
In this five column
by fives
Five times two
Five times three
Five times four
Two times four
by sixes
Six times three
Six times four
the multiplication table
that four times four is 16
Four times four
you could just go down this column and count by fours
12 plus four
in this column
from the row
four , eight
four times three
the greater than
symbol
more fours
what number
A and B
in the multiplication table
whatever four times five is
at whatever row or column it 's in
at its column , five , 10 , 15 , 20
whatever five times four is
Well look , A is gon na be " four times five which is 20
you multiply them in
you 're getting the sense of it
the last one we saw
whatever four
whatever one times four is
you see a pattern here
graphical depictions of the graphs y equals f of x
from our limit properties
that this is going to be the same thing as the limit as x
when we approach from the left , we are approaching the , the function seems to be approaching the value of negative one right over here
this limit here
that , as we approach it from the left , we are approaching one
the left ,[/E2] , we approach ,[/E2] , the function
the left , we approach , the function
we approach x equals zero from [E2]the left ,
we approach x equals zero from the left ,
the right , the function itself
that the function
, this is one
the limit of h of x
the value of the function is at x equals zero
the limit as we approach x equals zero
from the left
the right , the value of the function
zero from [E2]the right , the value of the function[/E2] function is also approaching zero
G of zero
that makes sense [E2]that[/E2] the limit and the actual value of the function at that point is the same
that makes [E2]sense[/E2] that the limit and the actual value of the function at that point is the same
by zero
it even clearer that that limit does not exist
benefits , benefits minus costs
an important idea
the benefit of say going to a movie or having some ice cream
Those types of things
as explicit costs
the opportunity cost
in economic terms
as the cost[/E2] cost of the next best alternative
as the cost of the next best alternative
that time
for something else
a rational actor
both of those
Movie tickets
$ 30 an hour mowing lawns , $ 12 an hour working in an ice cream shop , or $ 10 an hour weeding your aunt 's garden
the opportunity cost of going to a movie for three hours
The opportunity cost
the cost[/E2] cost of the next best alternative
well what about the $ 12 an hour for an ice cream shop or $ 10 an hour for weeding your aunt 's garden
that maybe there are n't any extra costs that are not , maybe you get extra tired from mowing lawns versus working in an ice cream shop , but we 're trying to simplify things , so let 's not get overly complicated right now
the next best alternative
at a very face level
$ 90
That 's the cost of not
That 's [E2]the cost of not
the cost of not , [E2]that[/E2] 's the opportunity cost of not mowing lawns
the cost of not[/E2] not , that 's the opportunity cost of not[/E2] not mowing lawns
the explicit cost of just the price of the movie ticket
the total cost of going to the movie
the quantity two X minus three squared
And I 'll give [E2]you[/E2] a little bit of a hint
And I 'll give you a little bit of a hint
in the traditional way of expanding this out , and then turning it into kind of a classic quadratic form
so this is really interesting
so this [E2]is really interesting
something squared
is really interesting , [E2]we[/E2] have something
is really interesting[/E2] interesting , we have something
is really interesting , we have something
for what the stuff in blue could be equal to , then we could solve for X
P squared
this equation simplifies quite nicely
the left - hand side becomes [E2]P squared
the left - hand side becomes P squared
to just one color
this shown multiple times
if I have the product of two things and they equal to zero
P minus two
that two X minus three is equal to P
either two
so this is pretty straightforward to solve
two X is equal to three
the possible solutions

I think [E2]I[/E2] 've heard of that before
one of the things that we have to understand about this time period is how religiously motivated many people were
Catholics
the natives
a much better understanding of the land itself that they were aiming to cultivate
it 's worthwhile to note here that we 're saying , oh they wanted the labor of the Native Americans
these plantations
as being something they needed to work directly
I would rather stay in the courts of Europe , I would rather be a lord
that 's definitely right

scenarios where we start with a differential equation and then we generate a slope field that describes the solutions
you have had a go at it
the way [E2]I 'm going to do it
I 'm going to do it[/E2] it is I 'm just going to find some points that seem to be easy to do arithmetic with , and we 'll see if the slope described by the differential equation at that point is consistent with the slope depicted in the slope field
just for simplicity
x equals one and y equals one for all of these
x equals one
any other
negative five and negative seven
the arithmetic a little easier
a positive slope
one , then one
for this magenta differential equation
this slope is not zero here
x plus y
like two
what is happening here
that as x increases
that the slope is increasing
that the slope increases
that the slope increases as we go to the top right
that it decreases as we go to the bottom left
like negative two , which is consistent with this yellow differential equation
The slope here
a positive one
about well , okay , what are the solutions for this differential equation going to look like
where they start or what points they contain
the line y is equal to negative x

that sine of x plus y
in this in other videos
the tangent of something
as a sine over cosine of that something
with that out of the way , [E2]I[/E2] wanna come up with a formula for tangent of x plus y
as the antilog for what we did up here for sine and cosine
the immediate thing [E2]that you might recognize
that you might recognize[/E2] recognize is that tangent of x plus y
in terms of tangents of xs and ys
the numerator
by cosine of x cosine y
the numerator by cosine of x cosine of y that would change the value of the , this rational expression
the numerator [E2]by cosine of x cosine of y[/E2] y that would change the value of the , this rational expression
by cosine of x cosine of y
this is a very complex looking fraction here
In the numerator
that this cosine y
that first term
this is going to be equal to sine of x
that this cosine of x
with sine of y
So plus tangent of y and then all of that is going to be over
at the denominator
the cosine of x cancels with the cosine of x and the cosine of y
you could view this first term here when you divide by this cosine of x cosine y
sine of x over cosine of x , sine of y
tangent of x
with an expression for tangent of x plus y that just deals with tangent of xs and tangent of ys
with an expression for tangent of x plus y that[/E2] that just deals with tangent of xs and tangent of ys
is going to be equal to sine of -x is the same thing as -sine of x ,
just the negative of the tangent of x
negative tangent of x
the reason why that is useful
I can rewrite this as being , write here
the same thing as tangent of x plus -y
with a -y
the tangent of -y is the same thing as the negative tangent of y
we could write the tangent of y here , and then the negative would turn this into a plus
that also the tangent of x minus y can be rewritten as tangent of x minus tangent of y all of that over 1 plus tangent of x and tangent of y.

I think [E2]I[/E2] 'm going to send you another sticker
where not everyone is taking them
This thing 's always going to be here
like the flu
you have the Delta variant
about booster shots
about , do we need a Delta aware vaccine
viruses
the first prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells , maybe even multicellular life
with viruses
the expectation
with these types of respiratory viruses
eventually we will reach an equilibrium state where the virus evolves to a place where it is causing minimally symptomatic disease , but enabling spread
our immune systems
that we can handle that assault
Vaccines
how can we as a global society best manage that to minimize the impact as we get to that equilibrium
it 's reasonable to expect that this Corona virus
other Corona viruses
the meantime[/E2] meantime , the question
the meantime , the question
in [E2]the meantime
in the meantime
how much do we need to keep working on future vaccines
we have to be driven by data
naturally infected people are producing a memory response
we see less severe disease and less hospitalizations and deaths in people who are previously vaccinated , but people who are previously vaccinated are able to get infected and spread
the health authorities then will figure out what the right right path forward is
it 's worth remembering that this is going to be an equilibrium that happens over time
it 's an incredible accomplishment of modern science that by the end of this year , my guess is , we 'll have over 10 billion doses of vaccine produced
an astonishing scientific achievement
sometimes people say , " Oh , well this goes over , " Or you know , " Something that you do n't necessarily see , it occurs over millions of years
with the flu virus
for a virus
for a virus , [E2]it[/E2] would n't naturally select for viruses that are necessarily more deadly
for a virus , it would n't naturally select for viruses that are necessarily more deadly
in the virus 's interest
everyone 's nightmare scenarios are something that spreads like Delta , you know , it 's very easy to spread , it can kind of evade at least the first phases of the immune system , and then kind of stays dormant while it spreads and then becomes worse and then becomes deadly
kind of dark science fiction thinking that we could go in that direction
billions
it 's , I mean , certainly all possible
Marburg
Lassa
very high case fatality rates
what the history would tell us and how you would expect for this to play out
even if you had a very , you know , more virulent strain , again , the human immune system is designed to , especially for these kinds of respiratory viruses , to develop a very robust immune response
Oh , it 's just another circulating cold virus
the flu
at one point
A big question
vaccines for younger people
other countries
on the vaccination of younger people
the last century , the biggest public health intervention , along with clean water , that 's happened in human history
pediatric vaccination
pediatric vaccination has been able to accomplish
it 's worth reminding ourselves that when we do get a pediatric vaccine approved , people should really look to vaccinate children
one of the most successful public health interventions that we 've ever had
Because children 's immune systems
that 's what 's being systematically done
how the data develops on that front
my guess
over time , we 'll be getting down in those younger and younger age groups
over the coming months , we 'll be able to get into the pediatric age range and then younger as well
- And does it change depending on what ,
billions of doses
pretty standard clinical trials
my own experience in vaccines
, these numbers are very large that they 're using
most of the databases here in the clinical studies
50,000 to 100,000 plus patients
very robust databases to identify significant safety signals , including in children
I have one of my oldest got vaccinated
despite the one - off news media reports that [E2]you[/E2] 're hearing
despite the one - off news media reports that you 're hearing
very low rates of hospitalization or severe disease
it 's probably even better than we see in the data because the denominator of number of children or adults who are asymptomatically infected or not captured is quite significant
- Yeah , could n't agree more , but [E2]it[/E2] is
a couple of questions that I paraphrased a little bit
for hours
about the vaccine and how all of this might evolve
one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world
a substantial Renaissance in how we think about therapeutics in medicine
in history , [E2]it[/E2] was really in the early 1900s
in history , it was really in the early 1900s
we began to think about medicine as being able to impact the human body
Before then
much less sophisticated views on how to impact health
with chemicals , so chemistry , small molecule chemicals that would interact with proteins to try to get a therapeutic effect
Around the 1970s , 1980s
into the world of producing large molecules , so proteins to impact proteins or proteins to bind other proteins or proteins to bind other things in the body
small molecules and biologics
Some of them , [E2]we[/E2] work on
cell therapies which are taking cells out of the body
1970s
1980s
the other revolution that 's happened that was years in the making

very small strands of RNA
Now all of these areas are opening up whole new
Now all of these areas are opening up [E2]whole new

of thinking of b times xy[/E2] xy , we actually think of this
as two times some constant times xy
what b represents
two vectors multiplied in but on either side
a good point
a matrix multiplied by a vector
that second term y
it looks like
as a horizontal vector or a one by two matrix
x multiplied by that entire top expression
y times b times x
the last term
y times c times y
the original quadratic form that we were shooting for
how this entire term expands
with the same quadratic expression
the convenience of this
that we can write this[/E2] this more abstractally and instead of writing the whole matrix in , you could just let a letter like m represent that whole matrix and then take the vector that represents the variable , maybe a bold faced x and you would multiply it on the right and then you transpose it and multiply it on the left so typically you denote that by putting a little t as a superscript so x transposed multiplied by the matrix from the left and this[/E2] this expression , this[/E2] this is what a quadratic form looks like in vectorized form and the convenience is the same as it was in the linear case
something that had a hundred different numbers in it and x would have a hundred different constants , [E2]you[/E2] could do something similar here where you can write that same expression even if the matrix m is super huge
x transpose multiplied by the matrix multiplied by x
in hand , in the next video
about how we can use this notation to express the quadratic approximations for multivariable functions
after making that change
an alternative hypothesis
our mean
greater than 20 minutes after the change
the next thing [E2]we do
we do[/E2] do is we set up a threshold known as the significance level and you will see how this comes into play in a second
other ones
" Hey , we ca n't reject the null hypothesis , " and we are n't able to have evidence for the alternative
In step three
a sample
the next step
we calculate a p - value
the p - value ,
a conditional probability
the probability that our sample mean when we take a sample of size n=100 is greater than or equal to 25 minutes , given our null hypothesis is true
about how to do this
we assume that the sampling distribution of the sample means is roughly normal , [E2]we[/E2] can use the sample mean

a t
statistic
whether we can reject the null hypothesis
my p - value , if it is less than Alpha , then [E2]I[/E2] reject my null hypothesis
the other situation , if my p - value is greater than or equal to , in this case 0.05 , so if it 's greater than or equal to my significance level , then [E2]I[/E2] can not reject the null hypothesis
I would n't say that [E2]I[/E2] accept the null hypothesis
I would n't say [E2]that I accept the null hypothesis
that I accept the null hypothesis
in that situation
the basis for significant tests
the thing that we 're using to decide whether or not we reject the null hypothesis , [E2]this[/E2] is the probability of getting your sample statistics given that the null hypothesis is true
country A
an autarky , a very fancy word , which just means that this country is operating independently
in isolation
the demand curve in this market in orange
when this country is operating in isolation , this market for widgets has an equilibrium price
that the price is in dollars per widget
an autarky
a different demand curve
in many situations
these two demand curves
a little bit of a review of what we 've seen in other videos
at a price of five
in total
anything , no quantity of these widgets
the market there
at a price of zero
in aggregate
that with supply , that at a price of five
country B
20 units per time period
as our supply and demand curves for the combined markets
in an autarky
our equilibrium quantity
a little bit under 10 units
some interesting things that are happening
the new equilibrium price
a , let 's put it a little bit over 2.5 , so let 's put it right over there
a situation where the suppliers in country B are going to be producing a lot , a lot more than they were before
only this amount
from their domestic demand
these exports
country A and country B or that they 're only trading with each other , [E2]these exports[/E2] exports become country A 's imports
proponents of free trade
hey , look , the overall consumer surplus is larger than the combined consumer surpluses that we had before
this consumer surplus
in country A
a similar story
The winners here
the demanders in country A
instead of this little , small consumer surplus that [E2]they[/E2] had before

several videos over evolution
people say evolution and Natural Selection really in the same breath
the one most talked about
many videos on Natural Selection
a population of living circles
in another variation
all about traits
Genetic Drift
change in heritable traits of a population over generations
a very small population of 10 rabbits
the capital B version
kind of a very Mendelian example that we 're showing here
that we have an equal amount of each
Even though the phenotype
a lot more brown
hey , why did I pick those top five
the bottom five
only these two
by pure random chance
from the point of view of these alleles
like random chance
another random chance
this white rabbit
It could happen even though that first randomness happened
a little bit of an advantage
from the environment that the bunnies are in point of view , it might have even been a better trait , but because of random chance , it disappears from the population
an example with 10 bunnies
Biologists
about small populations
specifically because of Genetic Drift
For random reasons
less diversity , less variation in your population , and even favorable traits could be selected for by random chance
ideas where you have significant reduction in population for slightly different reasons
Bottleneck Effect
you have some major disaster or event that kills off a lot of the population , so only a little bit of the population is able to survive
inside of that bottle
marbles of different colors
you have some yellow marbles
you have [E2]some yellow marbles
some yellow marbles
the colors that I tend to be using
some blue marbles
populations of things
in bottles
only a handful
after that disaster
a sudden , [E2]you[/E2] have a massive reduction not only in the population
Another example
Founder Effect , which is the same idea of a population becoming very small
a lot of different alleles
in that population
You have a lot of variation
You have [E2]a lot of variation
a lot of variation , [E2]you[/E2] have a lot of variation in that population
a lot of variation[/E2] variation , you have a lot of variation[/E2] variation in that population
a lot of variation in this population
a little undiscovered mountain pass
why it 's called the Founder Effect
the founders of a new population
Just the process of this
They 're a smaller population and they happen to be disproportionately or all blue in this[/E2] this case , and so now this[/E2] this population is going to ( mumbles )
They 're a smaller population and they happen to be disproportionately or all blue in this case , and so now this population is going to ( mumbles )
Genetic Drift where many alleles will have disappeared because you have such a small population of blues here
a really interesting thing to think about
Evolution and Natural Selection
about hand
Genetic Drift , which is really about , not selecting for favorable traits , it is about randomness

if we can take the indefinite integral of sine squared x cosine to the third x dx
u is equal to sine of x
The way that you can do that , if you have an odd exponent like this , is to separate out one of the cosine 's x

the Pythagorean Identity , is the same thing as one minus sine squared x
the Pythagorean Identity[/E2] Identity , is the same thing as one minus sine squared x
this sine squared

our fathers
on this continent

on a great battle - field of that war
that we should do this
The brave men ,
far above our poor power to add or detract
for us the living , rather , to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced
a new nation , conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
in case you 're wondering
87 years
a score
the tone to say here , in this nation , we are measuring time almost Biblicaly
a sacred mission
a very short period of time
in contradistinction to the concept that all men are created equal
a civil war
the democracy of the United States fails ,
that democracy does n't work
We are met on a great battle - field of that war
there are two important things here
about the concept of a nation
as The United States
that this is one united nation , not just a collection of states and that is what the American forces are fighting for
the forces of the United States are trying to achieve
, a united nation , not a united set of states
The other interesting thing here
that he mentions it 's altogether fitting and proper that we should do this
that it was kind of a cheap political maneuvering

A carbon - carbon double bond
a bond[/E2] bond enthalpy of 614 kilojoules per mole
more energy

slightly different values for this
depending on which textbook you 're looking in
that it takes energy to break bonds
energy to break bonds , [E2]that[/E2] means energy is given off when bonds form
So this bond is forming
The magnitude of energy is still 242 kilojoules per mole

The sides are parallel

at all the vertices
a nice rectangle
the rectangle
And I 'll give you a hint
where [E2]we[/E2] 're starting is right
the first thing I am going to do
instead of just doing log base two of x
's do[/E2] do log base two of x plus six
's do log base two of x[/E2] x plus six
the next thing we might wanna do
what is four time log base two of x plus six
you to think about
it is whatever y - value we were getting before , we 're now going to get four times that
a y - value of zero
a y - value of one
the graph of y
is the graph of y is equal to log base two of x plus six
is [E2]the graph of y[/E2] y is equal to log base two of x plus six
the last thing we have to consider
well we 're gon na take all of that and then we 're going to subtract seven to get to our target graph
So this is at y equals zero , but now we 're going to subtract seven
off the screen
to negative seven
at several ways of writing linear equations
in slope - intercept form , where it would be of the form of Y is equal to MX plus B , where M and B are constants

the graph that represents the XY pairs that satisfy this equation , it would intersect the y - axis
at the point
it 's slope
that you can also express things in point - slope form
slope - intercept
different ways of writing the same equations
to the other
Another way
point - slope
in point - slope form
that some , if you know that there 's an equation where the line that represents the solutions of that equation has a slope M
that X equals , X equals A
point - slope form
a form that you might have already seen
standard form
the shape of AX plus BY is equal to C , where A , B , and C are integers
the thing that standard form is really good for
, not just the y - intercept
72 , 72 divided by nine
Y is zero
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight
this point , that right over here
This point right over here
intercept
to the point where the line actually intersects the x - axis
we could solve
alright 16Y is equal to 72
Y is equal to 72 over 16
it 's 4.5
4.5
X is zero
one , two
, [E2]Y[/E2] is one , two , three , 4.5
, Y is one , two , three , 4.5
, Y is [E2]one , two[/E2] two , three , 4.5
just with these two points
just with these [E2]two points
two points , two points are enough to graph a line
two points[/E2] points , two points[/E2] points are enough to graph a line
I 've just graphed
the line that represents all the X and Y pairs that satisfy the equation 9X plus 16Y is equal to 72
standard form 's good at certain things
the y - intercept
at slope - intercept[/E2] intercept form , [E2]the y - intercept[/E2] intercept just kinda jumps out at you
neither the x nor the y - intercept kind of
At point - slope form
at you
The place where slope - intercept or point - slope form are frankly better
that it 's pretty easy to pick out the slope here , while in standard form you would have to do a little bit of work
You could use these two points
the x and y - intercepts
as two points
Okay , if I 'm going from " this point to this point , my change in X " to go from eight
that little delta there
" Okay , this is going to be " change in Y , 4.5 , over change in X , " over negative 8
negative nine over 16
out of this
into , into one of the other forms
9X
16Y is equal to negative 9X , plus 72
9/2
And you 'll be left with Y is equal to negative 9/16X , that 's the slope , you see it right there , plus 72 over 16
And you 'll be left with Y is equal to negative 9/16X , [E2]that 's the slope , you see it right there , plus 72 over 16
that 's the slope , you see it right there , plus 72 over 16 , [E2]we[/E2] already figured out that 's 9/2 or 4.5
that 's the slope , you see it right there , plus 72 over 16[/E2] 16 , we already figured out that 's 9/2 or 4.5
oh I 'll just write that as 4.5

one thing [E2]I notice
I notice[/E2] notice is I just used some simple trigonometry
this distance here if I know r , say I know r , this distance here x
x equals r cosine of theta
y equals r times the sin of theta
this distance here
how I get x and y
the Pythagorean theorem , r squared
opposite over adjacent
And now if I want to find theta I use another little bit of trigonometry
tangent is [E2]opposite over adjacent
tangent is opposite over adjacent
y over x
that theta equals the inverse tangent of y over x

the notion of area between a curve and the x - axis
this area right over here
based on what [E2]you[/E2] already know about definite integrals
with the original area that I cared about
with this area
from our integration properties
that we can rewrite this as the integral from a to b of , let me put some parentheses here , of f of x minus g of x , minus g of x dx
a claim
I know what [E2]you[/E2] 're thinking
I know what you 're thinking
okay well that worked when both of them were above the x - axis
the integral from c to d of g of x dx
a negative value
to , this is equivalent to the integral from c to d of f of x
even over this interval when one of , when f of x was above the x - axis
to the same thing
that we 're looking at intervals where f is greater than g
with now the endpoints being m and n
If [E2]we[/E2] were to evaluate that integral from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx here , of f of x
If we were to evaluate that integral [E2]from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx here , of f of x
If we were to evaluate that integral from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx[/E2] dx here , of f of x
from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx here , of f of x minus , minus g of x , we already know from our integral properties
from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx here , of f of x[/E2] x minus , minus g of x[/E2] x , we already know from our integral properties
from m to n of , I 'll just put my dx[/E2] dx here , of f of x minus , minus g of x , we already know from our integral properties
this is going to be equal to the integral from m to n of f of x dx
this is going to be equal to the integral from m to n of f of x[/E2] x dx
the magnitude of it
this area right over there
with the area that [E2]we[/E2] care about right over here , the area that we cared about originally
exactly that
the negative of that yellow area
to be the negative of the yellow area , you would net out once again to the area that we think about
the area between the curves
in every case we saw
just the definite integral over that interval of f of x minus g of x dx
Kurt Lash
the E
on the history of the Supreme Court
the advocates of the proposed Constitution had claimed [E2]that the national government would have only limited enumerated power , the state ratifying conventions
that the national government would have only limited enumerated power , the state ratifying conventions[/E2] conventions wanted that promise put in writing
an interpretive problem
Madison
that some address specific issues , like speech and the right to bear arms
The last two amendments on that list
broader issues of Constitutional interpretation
rules of construction
The Tenth Amendment
that all powers not delegated away remain under the control of the people in the states
The Ninth Amendment
the problem potentially raised by adding this list in a bill of rights
These amendments
the people 's retained right to local self government
a few examples of what those unenumerated rights that people have debated have been
rights that are fundamental
Some of these rights
the right to make and enforce contracts , to sue and be sued , to have basic economic rights[/E2] rights , and also to have the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus , which is in the original Constitution
the difficult issue of how exactly you determine what the rights are
The text of the Ninth Amendment itself
very little about the specific content of our retained rights
everything from wearing a hat to walking on the sidewalk , to purchasing life insurance , or determining where you can park your car , or what classes should be offered in the local high school
basically everything that was never meant to be handed to the control of the national government
By making a limited interpretation of federal power a right
the matter can be litigated in federal court and not just left to political compromise
courts
a body of law that invalidates attempts by the federal government to regulate our lives in forbidden ways , such as not having the power under the Commerce Clause to force us to purchase private health insurance or not having the power to commandeer state official and force them to enforce federal immigration policy
Englishmen
to some extent to kind of the common law of England and the things that were considered the natural rights of Englishmen
Not all of the common law rights[/E2] rights of Englishmen
natural rights
Common law[/E2] law rights
rights , basically , are rights[/E2] rights that were traditionally protected by English law
rights that had been recognized by English judges over centuries
Natural rights
from God or nature , not from government
a natural right
this beautiful preamble about what a natural right is
The Fourth Amendment
our right against unreasonable searches and seizures
The Third Amendment
the right not to have soldiers quartered in the home
A close look at the historical record
that this is not likely
nothing about either the Ninth or Tenth Amendments
the slave - holding rebel sates
that had violated this principle by demanding that slavery be enforced throughout the nation , regardless of local freedom laws
at the very least
a question of interpretation
the one thing that Madison said do
the rights that are not written down , are not enumerated , but are protected

the parallelogram
a parallelogram
parallel
just another way of saying that they 're going in the same direction
those arrows
They 're going ,
in the same way
about what makes a square special
a special type of parallelogram
Wait , " I see two opposite sides are parallel
One way to think about some things that are not parallel
if the lines kept going , they would cross each other
one set of opposite sides being parallel , but not the other
Another example of something that is not a parallelogram
the next one we 'll talk about
the rhombus
a type of parallelogram
a rhombus
" Well maybe a square is a rhombus
a square[/E2] square [E2]a rhombus
A square
all [E2]the sides of a square
the sides of a square[/E2] square are the same length
So one way to think about rhombuses , or rhombi , is they 're squares
my brain thinks of when I think of a rhombus
the word rectangle
it a rectangle
the things
in a rectangle
to , I guess you could call them square corners
what makes a rectangle
a parallelogram where all the corners are right angles
a little square
in the corners
a parallelogram , but not a rectangle
A rectangle
a parallelogram that has square corners
it 's a parallelogram
the corners
a square has
at right angles
the square
a really interesting quadrilateral
The square
it 's a rhombus
the type of rhombus where the corners are right angles
the type of rhombus[/E2] rhombus where the corners are right angles
This one[/E2] one right over here is not a square
rhombuses
a parallelogram where the corners are right angles , where they are square
all about making identical copies of a piece of DNA
usually [E2]it[/E2] 's a piece of DNA that codes for something we care about
usually it 's [E2]a piece of DNA that codes for something we care about
a piece of DNA that codes for something we care about , it is a gene that will express itself as a protein that we think is useful in some way
a piece of DNA that codes for something we care about[/E2] about , it is a gene that will express itself as a protein that we think is useful in some way
an animal
about cloning and DNA cloning we 're talking about something a little bit simpler
identical copies of a piece of DNA
the double - stranded DNA
copies of this
the first thing [E2]we wanna do
we wanna do[/E2] do is we wanna cut this gene out some how
specific sequences
restriction enzymes
one restriction enzyme , Let me use a different color here , that latches on right over here and identifies the genetic sequence right over here and cuts right in the right place
a restriction enzyme
just that gene
a little bit left over on either side
the restriction enzymes
a plasmid
itself
So then so this is where [E2]we[/E2] cut
So then so this is where we cut
you might have an overhang over there
you might have [E2]an overhang[/E2] overhang over there
an overhang
which will allow [E2]it[/E2] easier
into the plasmid
these solutions
The restriction enzymes
in mass
They 're bumping in just the right way to cause this reaction to happen
those genes
DNA ligase
DNA ligase , which you can think of it as helping to do , helping to do the pasting
this plasmid
an organism
bacteria and E
a vial
your plasmids , which would be even harder to see
in that solution
the bacteria to take up the plasmid
the typical shock
a heat shock
how the heat shock works
the bacteria
in the presence of our plasmids
it 's going to take it
nutrients
things like this , which would be many , many , many cells of bacteria
them grow
some of the bacteria will take up the plasmids and some wo n't
hey when this bacteria , when it keeps replicating it might form one of these , it might form one of these colonies
a colony that you like
for the bacteria that actually took up the plasmid
a gene for antibiotic resistance
that gene that allows it to not be susceptible to the antibiotics
a pretty cool thing
You started with the gene that [E2]you[/E2] cared about
these plasmids
in the presence of the bacteria
the plasmids
the next question , and I 'm over simplifying things fairly dramatically
well you now have a bunch of bacteria that have a bunch of copies of that gene , how do you make use of it
what would give the bacteria its antibiotic resistance
In [E2]the last video
the last video [E2]we[/E2] introduced the idea that we could represent any arbitrary , periodic function by a series of weighted cosines and sines
the last video[/E2] video we introduced the idea that we could represent any arbitrary , periodic function by a series of weighted cosines and sines
over the intervals zero to pi
over the intervals zero to pi over this video and the next few videos
over the intervals zero to pi[/E2] pi [E2]over this video and the next few videos
that the definite integral from zero to two pi of sine of mx , dx , actually let me stay in t
that that is equal to zero for any non - zero integer m
So [E2]we[/E2] 're gon na take the integral from zero to two pi of sine mt , dt
So [E2]we 're gon na take the integral from zero to two pi of sine mt[/E2] mt , dt
we 're gon na take the integral from zero to two pi of sine mt
so [E2]I[/E2] almost have negative m sine of mt
so I almost have negative m sine of mt
a negative m here
the value of the expression
cosine mt , cosine mt , evaluated at two pi and zero

that when people exercise longer , their body temperatures change
about the general form of our confidence interval , our t interval which we 're going to use , because we 're dealing with means
that Kylie will use the conservative degrees of freedom
that means [E2]that[/E2] she will look at each of those samples , so one has a sample size of 18 , one has a sample size of 24
one less than that
as her degrees of freedom

by 1/3
the series
as eight plus eight times 1/3 , eight times 1/3 , plus eight times 1/3 squared
okay , we could write this in sigma notation
at zero or at one
from k is equal to zero
this is an infinite series right here
just as a reality check
eight times 1/3 to the zero power , which is indeed eight
eight times
1/3 to the first power
what we have here
But just applying that over here , we are going to get
But just applying that over here [E2], we are going to get
, we are going to get
that they 're differences between lines
a value
at a point where it 's going to be easy for me to figure out what point we 're at
for this magenta line
So now , [E2]I[/E2] 've gone plus three in the horizontal direction
by three in the horizontal direction , I increase by six
by three [E2]in the horizontal direction , I increase by six
in the horizontal direction , I increase by six in the vertical
in the horizontal direction , I increase by six[/E2] six in the vertical
hey , let 's just measure how much to we increase in vertical for a given increase in the horizontal
what mathematicians use to describe the steepness of lines
a steep slope
slope
a measure for how steep something is
the convention
is , is we measure the increase in vertical for a given in increase in horizontal
six two
just the convention that mathematicians have defined for slope
our horizontal coordinate in this coordinate plane
the Greek letter delta
a math symbol used to represent change in
delta , delta
change in Y , change in Y , divided by change in X
that when our change in X is positive two
two divided by two , which is equal to one
however much we increase in X , we 're going to increase the same amount in Y
that , we increase one in X , we increase one in Y
From any point on the line
You increase three in X
from the math of it

about various functions of money
that it 's a medium of exchange
that it 's a store of value
inflation
that prices are increasing
$ 1.20
some videos talking about inflation itself and the root causes
the idea that prices increase really , really quickly
in 12 different times
the annual inflation rate , the percentage per year
100,000 % per year
four different people
I guess [E2]I[/E2] should give person D some eyes
for all of his things
in response
A things
all of her things
from C
the full 50 dollars that she earned
as an economy
That one person 's income
another person 's expenses
you were person A and [E2]you[/E2] knew that prices of things are gon na increase , you might in anticipation raise your prices as you 're selling things to D
you were person A and you knew that prices[/E2] prices of things are gon na increase , you might in anticipation raise [E2]your prices[/E2] prices as you 're selling things to D
your prices
geez now I have to pay more so I 'm gon na have to charge my customer C a little bit more as well
I 'm gon na have to charge my customer more as well
in order to make ends meet
this circumstance where you 're changing your prices in anticipation of future change
what distinguishes hyperinflation in a qualitative sense from regular inflation
there 's a quote that I really like
it 's by Napoleon
that hyperinflation is n't just that it 's a much bigger number
that there 's a psychological difference in the society where people are starting to anticipate changes and change their prices accordingly
how things spiral out of control
how you get insane numbers like 80 % per month
about hyperinflation
as a medium of exchange
a store of value
that even in an ordinary inflation circumstance money does n't quite serve this function as a store of value because even if prices are increasing only very slowly every year , it 's still the case that a dollar that you hold on to , you 're not investing it or collecting interest rate , slowly degrades over time
that even in an ordinary circumstance , store of value does n't quite apply due to inflation
the numbers that you 're seeing
to value
throughout history
for a more stable number
this unit of value property
in the case of hyperinflation
something different between hyperinflation and regular inflation
as our unit of value
one of the core distinctions
that 's actually very important for what distinguishes hyperinflation from inflation in a qualitative sense

URVs
that 's really powerful actually that you can recognize that one of the functions of money has broken down and then address it specifically and invent something new that addresses that same function
a little bit of light
on why it might be useful to break down the functions of money in terms of these three different categories
a vector field
a two dimensional example
something that has a two dimensional input
the output
the important part
the example I have in mind
X times Y as that first component
a nice one to start with
it , in this case , [E2]it[/E2] 's another
it , [E2]in this case[/E2] case , it 's another
it , in this case , it 's another
a function of X and Y
like a variable
That Y squared
the vector field
you kind of take the whole X Y plane and you 're gon na fill it with vectors
a given input
an input you wanna look at
you kinda go X equals one
This input point
X equals one , and Y
Y squared
two squared
this vector two , three that we want to associate with that input point
the two points
an X component of two and then a Y component of three
the vector
to all the different points
ones that are blue
of
for partial derivatives
our original input
what 's the resulting change to the output
Maybe [E2]it[/E2] looks
Maybe it looks
what I mean by that
in just a moment
a good way to start is to just move them to a new space where they 're rooted in the same spot
V one
V two
in only a very small way
in terms of tip to tail with vectors
Kind of [E2]the green vector
the green vector[/E2] vector plus that blue vector[/E2] vector is the same as that pink vector[/E2] vector that connects the tail of the original one
Hey , what happens if we take this , the nudge , the size of the nudge of the output , and then we divide it by the nudge of the input
That changing vector V divided by the X , you 'd be dividing it by zero point five
this little DV
one half of some other vector
that other vector
what the partial derivative is
this other vector here ,
DV ,[/E2] , you know ,[/E2] , scaled down or scaled up ,[/E2] , however you want to think about it ,[/E2] , by that partial X
what makes it such the , you know , in principle if this partial X change was really small , like one 100th and the output nudge was also really small , it 's like one 100th , or you know something on that
the DVDX ,
a normal sized vector
the direction that it points
kind of an indication of the direction that this green vector should change as you 're scooting over
just how wrong my drawing was to start here
what the pink vector would be
that should be something
the , what turns out to be , the wrong direction
the change would be in the direction kind of two as the X component
all corresponding little DV nudges , will be slight changes , will be slight changes on that
your , your DVs
the X direction and consider the various vectors attached to each point , as you kind of passing through the point one , two , the way that the vectors are changing
down and to the right
The tip
something that kind of like I do n't know , like this , where it 's getting shorter in the Y direction , but then longer in X direction , as per that blue nudging arrow

as the sum of two rational expressions that have a lower degree in the denominator

okay , can we write this as the sum of something , let 's call that A , over X plus one
the first term [E2]I[/E2] would multiply the numerator and the denominator
the first term I would multiply the numerator and the denominator
X minus one
A times X minus one
we keep writing over and over again
over that
the X terms
as , so if we take AX plus BX that 's going to be A plus B times X
a negative A and a B
the crux of partial fraction expansion
okay we kind of went through this whole exercise on the thesis that we could do this , that there is some A and B for which this is true
the coefficient of the X term
an A and a B
the left hand sides
two B is equal to negative three or B is equal to negative three halves
that A is equal to one minus B , which would be equal to one plus three halves
this whole integral
in a way that is a little bit easier to take the anti or this whole expression so it 's easier to integrate

If x is equal to negative , I 'll write that as negative one half , then what
two times negative one half is negative one minus three is indeed negative four
any , any-- for any x value that you put here and the corresponding y value it is going to sit on the line
a solution to this linear equation
a solution to a linear equation
to five [E2]you[/E2] go to the line
that y is going to be seven
that 's indeed the case
minus three
Two times five is ten
the only way that we could write a linear equation
a linear equation like-- let me do this in a new color
a linear equation like this : Four x minus three y is equal to twelve
that if we were to graph the xy pairs that satisfy this we would once again get a line
the point zero comma negative four , zero comma negative four on this line
Three comma zero
this is , [E2]this[/E2] line is going to look something like-- something like , I 'll just try to hand draw it
Wait , wait , wait , is n't any equation a linear equation ?
something like y is equal to x - squared
that this is going to be a curve
something like x times y is equal to twelve
like five over x plus y is equal to ten
One way to think about
it 's an equation that if you were to graph all of the x and y pairs that satisfy this equation , you 'll get a line
the word linear equation comes from
it is it[/E2] it 's going to be an equation where every term is either going to be a constant
It 's not going to change based on the value of some variable
the constant two times x to the first power
the variable y raised to the first power
We just have y to the first power
x to the first power
x and y
with a linear equation
In the video on the second law of thermodynamics
about how the entropy of the universe is constantly increasing , that it 's not going to decrease
that the energy in the universe , more and more of it[/E2] it is going towards entropy , it[/E2] it 's becoming less and less useful
even in our every day
about hey , while I 'm making this video , my body 's generating heat , and that heat is leading to entropy , it 's leading to more entropy in the universe
a reasonable question
how does heat lead to entropy
these molecules
at some temperature
a transfer of thermal energy , which we call heat
a heat transfer coming into this
entropy
our state
purely by position , not purely by where the different things are
The state
everything about the system
a higher temperature , you have a larger number of potential velocities that you might be able to actually take on
If [E2]they[/E2] 're going with only a reasonable kinetic energy , if they go with a reasonable kinetic energy , they might be able to get
these things came in really , really fast and smushed into each other , while these were nice and polite , and came it at a nice gentle velocity
more positional states , more different configurations
in three - dimensional space
why heat is actually leading to entropy
what some of you might be saying , well heat does n't only cause disorder , in fact , heat can be used to do work
the whole basis
an example of that happening
some molecules in here buzzing around with some temperature
in this system
I do n't have just a closed boundary ,
these things start buzzing around more
more , [E2]they[/E2] can take on more states
more , they can take on more states
more ,[/E2] , they can take on more states
more , they can take on more[/E2] more states

some work being done
a lot of them
One way to[/E2] to think about it ,
One way to think about it ,
heat is transfer of thermal energy ,[/E2] , that happens at the boundary of the system ,[/E2] , this heat could be you know ,[/E2] , maybe there 's a ,[/E2] , maybe there 's a flame down here ,[/E2] , and at the boundaries this thing might be able to
heat is transfer of thermal energy , that happens at the boundary of the system[/E2] system , this heat could be you know , maybe there 's a , maybe there 's a flame down here , and at the boundaries this thing might be able to
, and this has always helped me ,[/E2] , is heat is transfer of thermal energy ,[/E2] , that happens at the boundary of the system
, and this has always helped me , is [E2]heat is transfer of thermal energy , that happens at the boundary of the system
the system[/E2] system , the heat is just leading the increased thermal energy
the system , [E2]the heat is just leading[/E2] leading the increased thermal energy

within [E2]the system

at the boundaries of the system
why , when I talk about you know , if I move around and I 'm walking on the floor , just the friction of the carpet is going to generate heat
, the cellular processes in my body [E2]that[/E2] generate heat , it increases the entropy of the universe that makes the total energy of the universe less useful
, the cellular processes in my body that generate heat , it increases the entropy of the universe that makes the total energy of the universe less useful

We have two polar graphs here
kind of the overlap of these two circles
you 've tried
Cosine of pi over four
the same thing as sine of pi over four
thetas
our area
into those two regions
this region right over here
one thing [E2]that might jump out to you
that might jump out to you[/E2] you is that they 're going to be the same area
nine , three squared
nine , three squared[/E2] squared is [E2]nine sine squared[/E2] squared theta
sine square theta
the same thing as one half times one minus cosine of two theta
So if [E2]we[/E2] replace this with this it 's going to be equal to , let 's take the one half out , so
u substitution
the derivative of sine two theta
nine halves times pi over four minus one half sine of two
Sine of pi over two we already know
So this is going to be nine halves times
pi over four minus one half
in order to do this
a diameter
through the circle
in other compass construction or construction videos
those two points of intersection
And where they intersect is going to be exactly along--
a circle of the exact same dimensions
at the same place
on to this side , the other side of my diameter
those two points
a shape whose vertices intersect the circle
perpendicular bisectors

In the last video we looked at this RC circuit and we gave it [E2]a step input with a step source ,
In the last video we looked at this RC circuit and we gave it a step input with a step source ,
an intuitive guess at what this voltage looks like here
V and T
one of the things we can do
well , first thing we always do[/E2] do is we always label the quantities that we want in here , and I 'll put , there 's the current , and here we 'll call this voltage of R , and if I 've used a lowercase letter V or I , that means that quantity is changing with time
that V R
one I
So this I here
a good relationship for us to know
V S
V C
V R equals V S minus V C
C DV DT equals one over R times
V R V R is V S minus V C
C DV DT equals one over R V

this term right here
zero in that equation
a mixture of things going on here
This side of [E2]the equation
the equation[/E2] equation represents the forcing function
the circuit is being driven to by that step response input voltage source
a strategy
into two pieces
what engineers do when they 're faced with something that is a little complicated , is you try to break it into bits and pieces
what the circuit really does
two new words
the forced response
the natural response
what the circuit did when nothing was forcing it
some initial energy ,
the circuit is going to do altogether
another good application of super position
So they way [E2]we[/E2] do this , the strategy is for the natural response
So they way [E2]we do this , the strategy is for the natural response

that 's the charge on the capacitor
whatever we get
the initial Q and the initial V W
the inputs
V of S
you get the total response
with a plus sign
for the total response
for [E2]the total response
the total response , [E2]you[/E2] get the initial conditions , which is Q and V not
the total response[/E2] response , you get the initial conditions , which is Q and V not

about what r times the sum is
the r times that sum
the [E2]r times that sum
r times that sum , r times the sum of the first nth terms
r times that sum[/E2] sum , r times the sum[/E2] sum of the first nth terms
right underneath this one
the equivalent of multiplying negative times the sum
the negative r
where this is going
that 's [E2]that[/E2] term times negative r
that term times negative r
the term before this times negative r
the term right before this
You multiply [E2]this[/E2] times the negative , you get the negative a and then r to the n minus one times r , or times r to the first
