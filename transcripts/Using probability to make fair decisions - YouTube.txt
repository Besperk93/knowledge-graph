- [Instructor] We're told that Roberto and Jocelyn
00:01
decide to roll a pair of fair six-sided dice
00:05
to determine who has to dust their apartment.
00:08
If the sum is seven, then Roberto will dust.
00:11
If the sum is 10 or 11, then Jocelyn will dust.
00:15
If the sum is anything else, they'll roll again.
00:19
Is this a fair way to decide who dusts?
00:22
Why or why not?
00:24
So pause this video and see
00:25
if you can figure this out before we do it together.
00:28
All right, now let's do this together.
00:31
So what I wanna do is make a table that shows
00:33
all of the different scenarios for rolling
00:37
two fair six-sided dice.
00:40
So let me make columns for roll one.
00:44
So that is when you get a one.
00:48
This is when you get a two.
00:49
This is when you get a three.
00:51
This is when you get a four.
00:53
This is when you get a five.
00:55
And then, this is when you get a six.
00:58
And then here, let's do the other die.
01:02
So this is when you get a one.
01:04
This is when you get a two.
01:06
This is when you get a three.
01:08
This is when you get a four.
01:10
This is when you get a five.
01:13
And then, this is when you get a six.
01:15
So one way to think about it
01:16
is this is roll one
01:21
or let me write it this way,
01:22
d1 and d2.
01:25
This could be a one, a two, a three, a five or a six.
01:29
And this could be a one, a two, a three, a four,
01:33
a five or a six.
01:36
Now what we could do is fill in these 36 squares
01:40
to figure out what the sum is.
01:41
Actually, let me just do that
01:42
and I'll try to do it really fast,
01:43
one + one is two.
01:44
So it's three, four, five, six, seven.
01:49
This is three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
01:53
This is four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
01:57
This is five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
02:02
This is six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
02:06
Last but not least,
02:07
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 and 12,
02:11
took a little less time than I suspected.
02:13
All right, let's think about this scenario.
02:15
If the sum is seven, then Roberto will dust.
02:18
So where is the sum seven?
02:20
So we have that ones, twice, three times,
02:24
four, five, six.
02:27
So six out of, so six of these outcomes
02:30
result in a sum of seven.
02:32
And how many possible equally likely outcomes are there?
02:36
Well, there are six times six
02:38
equally possible outcomes or 36.
02:41
So six out of the 36
02:43
or this is another way of saying
02:44
there's a 1/6 probability that Roberto will dust.
02:48
And then, let's think about the 10s or 11s.
02:51
If the sum is 10 or 11,
02:53
then Jocelyn will dust.
02:56
So 10 or 11,
02:58
so we have one, two,
03:01
three, four, five.
03:05
So this is only happening five out of the 36 times.
03:10
So in any given roll,
03:11
it's a higher probability that Roberto
03:14
will dust than Jocelyn will dust.
03:16
And of course, if neither of these happen,
03:18
they are going to roll again.
03:19
But on that second roll,
03:20
there's a higher probability that Roberto will dust
03:23
than Jocelyn will dust.
03:24
So in general, this is not fair.
03:27
There's a higher probability that Roberto dusts.
03:30
So this is our choice.
